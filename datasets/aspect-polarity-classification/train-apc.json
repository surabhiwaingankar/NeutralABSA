{"text":"I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.","id":"812"}
{"text":"The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the \"sales\" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.","id":"1316"}
{"text":"I investigated netbooks and saw the Toshiba NB305-N410BL.","id":"2328"}
{"text":"The other day I had a presentation to do for a seminar at a large conference in town- lots of people, little time to prep and have to set up a computer to a projector, etc.","id":"2193"}
{"text":"it is of high quality, has a killer GUI, is extremely stable, is highly expandable, is bundled with lots of very good applications, is easy to use, and is absolutely gorgeous.","id":"2005"}
{"text":"Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops.","id":"2789"}
{"text":"Sad very SAD.","id":"425"}
{"text":"I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!","id":"76"}
{"text":"Needless to say a PC that can't support a cell phone is less than useless!","id":"747"}
{"text":"Great laptop that offers many great features!","id":"80"}
{"text":"they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.","id":"796"}
{"text":"\u00a0One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.","id":"917"}
{"text":"Still pretty pricey, but I've been putting off money for a while as a little Macbook Fund, and finally got to use it.","id":"1788"}
{"text":"My only disappointment with the 13\" model is that they're the only ones in the MacBook Pro line up without an i5 or i7 processor and dual graphics cards, however the trade-off is that you achieve a longer battery life (of about 2 more hours).","id":"338"}
{"text":"I took it back for an Asus and same thing- blue screen which required me to remove the battery to reset.","id":"1630"}
{"text":"In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).","id":"38"}
{"text":"However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).","id":"337"}
{"text":"Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.","id":"1505"}
{"text":"I HATE this one.","id":"263"}
{"text":"They were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place.","id":"1227"}
{"text":"Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.","id":"1019"}
{"text":"Oh, boy!","id":"1158"}
{"text":"But while this is one big advantage (as you may know from the company s recent commercials) there are other things to consider before going with Apple.","id":"1168"}
{"text":"I love the way the entire suite of software works together.","id":"2568"}
{"text":"The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.","id":"295"}
{"text":"on the bright side at least I wasn't without my laptop for long this time!","id":"951"}
{"text":"This laptop meets every expectation and Windows 7 is great!","id":"2759"}
{"text":"That's how frustrating it was.","id":"2055"}
{"text":"I can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly.","id":"2980"}
{"text":"The one down side to it is that when I play a certin game on here, it tends to freeze up sometimes, but thats the only bad thing about this computer.","id":"2454"}
{"text":"-No backlit keyboard, but not an issue for me.","id":"1054"}
{"text":"When I finally had everything running with all my software installed I plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed.","id":"743"}
{"text":"I can't even turn it off.","id":"1155"}
{"text":"One suggestion I do have, is to not bother getting Microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a PC.","id":"2587"}
{"text":"Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it's a snap.","id":"2202"}
{"text":"I shopped around before buying.","id":"2799"}
{"text":"I also got the added bonus of a 30\" HD Monitor, which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh!","id":"2227"}
{"text":"Would do business again.","id":"2241"}
{"text":"The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.","id":"92"}
{"text":"After paying several hundred dollars for this service, it is frustrating that you cannot get help after hours.","id":"1204"}
{"text":"I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.","id":"2026"}
{"text":"What a waste.","id":"535"}
{"text":"It was a total Dhell experience that I will never repeat.","id":"478"}
{"text":"There are a few flaws as well that I noticed.","id":"1690"}
{"text":"Completely worth every single penny dime and nickel.","id":"1789"}
{"text":"I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.","id":"250"}
{"text":"I did have to replace the battery once, but that was only a couple months ago and it's been working perfect ever since.","id":"325"}
{"text":":) In the past four years I've had it I have never once gotten a virus.","id":"324"}
{"text":"I love the operating system and the preloaded software.","id":"1574"}
{"text":"They were great in handling this problem, and I'm looking forward in purchasing additonal products from them in the future.","id":"1005"}
{"text":"I've tried going back to XL but there still problems.","id":"989"}
{"text":"The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.","id":"3073"}
{"text":"After numerous attempts of trying (including setting the clock in BIOS setup directly), I gave up(I am a techie).","id":"1254"}
{"text":"YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TALK TO AN AMERICAN WARRANTY SERVICE IS OUT OF COUNTRY.","id":"810"}
{"text":"But it may be potentially hundreds or thousands in the near future.","id":"1346"}
{"text":"Has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device.","id":"2383"}
{"text":"but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.","id":"130"}
{"text":"It cannot save the correct date and time I set.","id":"1253"}
{"text":"I sent it back to Toshiba twice they covered it under the  warranty.","id":"839"}
{"text":"And this isn't just my one experine.","id":"1473"}
{"text":"They sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that I return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later.","id":"782"}
{"text":"I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.","id":"696"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this one to my friends","id":"2878"}
{"text":"I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict.","id":"226"}
{"text":"And these are some reasons you should get a macbook pro.","id":"1652"}
{"text":"Also kinda loud when the fan was running.","id":"1030"}
{"text":"In desparation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me (\"have your credit card ready\").","id":"1425"}
{"text":"I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email.","id":"2861"}
{"text":"There also seemed to be a problem with the hard disc as certain times windows loads but claims to not be able to find any drivers or files.","id":"661"}
{"text":"Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.","id":"997"}
{"text":"-they lost my laptop for a month","id":"192"}
{"text":"Spent 2 hours on phone with HP Technical Support.","id":"463"}
{"text":"This is my second laptop,and it is head and shoulders above my first.","id":"2866"}
{"text":"at first!","id":"935"}
{"text":"Speaking of the browser, it too has problems.","id":"1193"}
{"text":"I think just going from PC to Mac has gotten me totally spoiled and I can't imagine ever going back.","id":"2192"}
{"text":"The keyboard is too slick.","id":"147"}
{"text":"Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.","id":"1433"}
{"text":"It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!","id":"1669"}
{"text":"It's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.","id":"2462"}
{"text":"Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.","id":"2719"}
{"text":"I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the Toshiba Warranty.","id":"1224"}
{"text":"I LOVE IT!","id":"588"}
{"text":"Amazing Quality!","id":"2492"}
{"text":"The fact that you can spend over $100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine.","id":"1541"}
{"text":"I mainly use it for email, internet, and managing personal files (pics, vids, etc.).","id":"3060"}
{"text":"A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.","id":"915"}
{"text":"The system it comes with does not work properly, so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all.","id":"2050"}
{"text":"Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.","id":"460"}
{"text":"I took it back to Best Buy where they were so helpful and immediately gave me a new one.","id":"1954"}
{"text":"If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer.","id":"1728"}
{"text":"*2 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Called headquarters, they report that they have not looked at it yet but it is \"on the top of the stack\".","id":"620"}
{"text":"This machine delivers.","id":"2423"}
{"text":"Then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the MacBook Pro.","id":"1781"}
{"text":"I complain again...","id":"645"}
{"text":"This laptop is insane!!!","id":"2"}
{"text":"If a website ever freezes (which is rare), its really easy to force quit.","id":"1524"}
{"text":"It does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern.","id":"2472"}
{"text":"It rarely works and when it does it's incredibly slow.","id":"803"}
{"text":"I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.","id":"2225"}
{"text":"It's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!","id":"2644"}
{"text":"Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.","id":"1365"}
{"text":"I always swore by PCs and would never consider a MAC.","id":"1555"}
{"text":"what an elegant, wonderful machine.","id":"2199"}
{"text":"This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it!","id":"72"}
{"text":"for 2 months.","id":"1151"}
{"text":"I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.","id":"2033"}
{"text":"Do you ever think HP would do that? NEVER!","id":"2113"}
{"text":"We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.","id":"2271"}
{"text":"It's not like I have used for half a year and then complained about it.","id":"1307"}
{"text":"Still trying to learn how to use it.","id":"2186"}
{"text":"The reality was, it heated up very quickly, and took way too long to do simple things, like opening my Documents folder.","id":"103"}
{"text":"I bought the netbook because it was smaller and lighter for me to carry around.","id":"1875"}
{"text":"The Genius at the Apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure.","id":"1359"}
{"text":"We'll save our money to replace it with a Mac again!","id":"2483"}
{"text":"Thank you for your great product!","id":"2945"}
{"text":"this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this \"never\" happen...","id":"197"}
{"text":"I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive.","id":"1149"}
{"text":"Sorry Toshiba, but 1st impressions do count for something.","id":"163"}
{"text":"Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.","id":"900"}
{"text":"And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high speed.","id":"1649"}
{"text":"Overall this laptop is great.","id":"2972"}
{"text":"I love the glass touchpad.","id":"446"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.","id":"1912"}
{"text":"I am using the external speaker- sound is good.","id":"2752"}
{"text":"The Apple MC371LL\/A 2.4Ghz 15.4-inch MacBook Pro Notebook is a horrible waste of money.","id":"270"}
{"text":"Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.","id":"2646"}
{"text":"As of a couple weeks ago the middle portion of the laptop from top to bottom,,,about 4 inches across is hardly visible.","id":"886"}
{"text":"still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better, but am very happy with the upgrade.","id":"2381"}
{"text":"Then HP sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up, not able to connect.","id":"404"}
{"text":"I just hope the reputation that Toshiba has is true and I won't have to worry about a crash.","id":"2772"}
{"text":"Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.","id":"407"}
{"text":"I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express.","id":"699"}
{"text":"Good luck.","id":"1034"}
{"text":"Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software.","id":"1731"}
{"text":"\u00a0 My favorite by far, although the most expensive, was my Sony.","id":"1863"}
{"text":"And if you do a lot of writing, editing is a problem since there is no  forward delete  key.","id":"1186"}
{"text":"Also I typed faster then then letters would show and it got to be realy annoying.","id":"1029"}
{"text":"As an owner of a Toshiba Satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy.","id":"1014"}
{"text":"Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.","id":"2470"}
{"text":"It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.","id":"331"}
{"text":"I shipped out on Saturday, July 17.","id":"1073"}
{"text":"I bought it for really cheap also and it's AMAZING.","id":"2788"}
{"text":"Acer has set me up with FREE recovery discs, when they are available since I asked.","id":"1057"}
{"text":"I also purchased Office Max's \"Max Assurance\" with the \"no lemon\" clause.","id":"1095"}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the market for a new laptop (and have the money) don't exclude looking at the MBPs.","id":"210"}
{"text":"I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB.","id":"1718"}
{"text":"Those things are very important - vital even!","id":"2770"}
{"text":"-They say it will take \"up to two weeks\".","id":"642"}
{"text":"I didn't like one thing about it.","id":"471"}
{"text":"The battery life seems to be very good, and have had no issues with it.","id":"2923"}
{"text":"Enabling the battery timer is useless.","id":"3027"}
{"text":"Temperatures on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures.","id":"654"}
{"text":"Yeah, to you.","id":"1340"}
{"text":"I got a mac as my HS graduation gift.","id":"2638"}
{"text":"I have now had it for 1.5 months and love it.","id":"2099"}
{"text":"It turned out it's not really a problem to have a Mac.","id":"58"}
{"text":"Page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something.","id":"2716"}
{"text":"Images can be multi-selected and viewed swiftly or in slideshow mode.","id":"2317"}
{"text":"Going to bring it to service today.","id":"1110"}
{"text":"There is no need to purchase virus protection for Mac, which saves me a lot of time and money.","id":"1488"}
{"text":"But we had paid for bluetooth, and there was none.","id":"488"}
{"text":"So, I paid a visit to LG notebook service center at Alexandra Road, hoping they can make the hinge tighter.","id":"1289"}
{"text":"My daughter uses it for games, email, facebook, pictures and music.","id":"2985"}
{"text":"Laptop is to be used like a Netbook.","id":"2145"}
{"text":"It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.","id":"1573"}
{"text":"After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard.","id":"1928"}
{"text":"Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient.","id":"704"}
{"text":"It was slow, locked up, and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months!","id":"1099"}
{"text":"they had to replace the motherboard in April","id":"1347"}
{"text":"Yes, the computer was light weight, less expensive than the average laptop, and was pretty self explantory in use.","id":"1408"}
{"text":"Also, if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.","id":"1374"}
{"text":"There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.","id":"34"}
{"text":"I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.","id":"2864"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.","id":"815"}
{"text":"It Was a great deal after all.","id":"2801"}
{"text":"This mac is great!","id":"1568"}
{"text":"Keyboard is great, very quiet for all the typing that I do.","id":"30"}
{"text":"I grew up in a design family so it only made sense.","id":"362"}
{"text":"Gave phonenumber.","id":"619"}
{"text":"It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow.","id":"708"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness-I am not a happy camper.","id":"167"}
{"text":"Dell's customer disservice is an insult to it's customers who pay good money for shoddy products.","id":"474"}
{"text":"I'd recommend this laptop to anyone!","id":"1563"}
{"text":"Yet, HP won't do anything about the problem.","id":"172"}
{"text":"i'm returning mine","id":"1396"}
{"text":"It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use, and would not move past this error.","id":"156"}
{"text":"I can render AVCHD movies with little effort, which was a problem for most pc's unless you had a quad core I7.","id":"2095"}
{"text":"It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.","id":"46"}
{"text":"This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables.","id":"418"}
{"text":"After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.","id":"1722"}
{"text":"If you really want a bang-up system and don't need to run Windows applications, go with an Apple;","id":"2004"}
{"text":"You won't have to spend gobs of money on some inefficient virus program that needs to be updated every month and that constantly drains your wallet.","id":"2296"}
{"text":"This laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials.","id":"1514"}
{"text":"One of them seems to have worked.","id":"2699"}
{"text":"Which I still use and have hooked up to my TV.","id":"524"}
{"text":"The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable.","id":"155"}
{"text":"It weighed like seven pounds or something like that.","id":"493"}
{"text":"2 months later, the battery went.","id":"902"}
{"text":"You may need to special order a bag.","id":"2433"}
{"text":"It's color is even cool.","id":"1675"}
{"text":"and it has blue screen crashed on me twice.","id":"3000"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Another two weeks later and it was back in my possession.","id":"954"}
{"text":"keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.","id":"609"}
{"text":"I've owned every \"Pro\" model Apple laptop for the last 8 years, this is BY FAR the WORST one I've ever had.","id":"50"}
{"text":"We purchase the Dell XPS several years ago for my home business.","id":"1265"}
{"text":"Have purchased many products over the years from MacConnection and this transaction, like all the others, we smoothly with no problems.","id":"2150"}
{"text":"I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express.","id":"1777"}
{"text":"Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.","id":"296"}
{"text":"He gave me this PC about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it.","id":"1585"}
{"text":"I'm pleased.","id":"2444"}
{"text":"The keyboard feels good and I type just fine on it.","id":"2335"}
{"text":"With a healthy pessimism, I took the machine home and tried to find a flaw.","id":"1635"}
{"text":"Shiny  This Laptop is the Best of the best!","id":"1661"}
{"text":"I thought the white Mac computers looked dirty too quicly where you use the mousepad and where you place your hands when typing.","id":"2416"}
{"text":"And not to mention after using it for a few months or so, the battery will slowly less and less hold a charge until you can't leave it unplugged for more than 5 minutes without the thing dying.","id":"1471"}
{"text":"Don't waste their money, save it and but a mac.","id":"1388"}
{"text":"Money and time well spent!","id":"715"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Gradually the freezing screen evolved into a screen that froze in weird shapes.","id":"1901"}
{"text":"BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple","id":"1427"}
{"text":"Good laptop for the money.","id":"2389"}
{"text":"I like the laptop overall.","id":"2667"}
{"text":"I now travel with this laptop and my work PC.","id":"1618"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I am however pleased that it is still hanging in there.","id":"1460"}
{"text":"Both my husband and I have this model Toshiba.","id":"2964"}
{"text":"no complaints with their desktop, and maybe because it just sits on your desktop, and you don't carry it around, which could jar the hard drive, or the motherboard.","id":"911"}
{"text":"Yes, they cost more, but they more than make up for it in speed, construction quality, and longevity.","id":"2001"}
{"text":"Since I keyboard over 100 wpm, I look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard (no keys sticking or lagging, strange configuration of \"extra key\", etc.","id":"2465"}
{"text":") I also tried the touch pad and compared it to other netbooks in the store.","id":"2331"}
{"text":"It absolutely is more expensive than most PC laptops, but the ease of use, security, and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag.","id":"599"}
{"text":"\u00a0 It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.","id":"823"}
{"text":"lots of preloaded software.","id":"3006"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Sony, Acer, Dell, Packard Bell and Toshiba.","id":"1861"}
{"text":"and then, a guy came out to serve me instead.","id":"1301"}
{"text":"Breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4+ people to report the damaged part will be returned late!","id":"788"}
{"text":"Have returned that laptop unused.","id":"2056"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Will probably never buy a HP again.","id":"825"}
{"text":"I got tired of buying laptops and having them stop working after a year.","id":"1823"}
{"text":"I should have been more observant.","id":"2439"}
{"text":"I wish it had a webcam though, then it would be perfect!","id":"2941"}
{"text":"My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.","id":"2776"}
{"text":"Another thing I might add is the battery life is excellent.","id":"1686"}
{"text":"One drawback, I wish the keys were backlit.","id":"2091"}
{"text":"When the buyer returned it Wal Mart just boxed it, taped it shut  resold it as new.","id":"727"}
{"text":"What a great little laptop.","id":"3001"}
{"text":"Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.","id":"1259"}
{"text":"I wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month.","id":"2938"}
{"text":"I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.","id":"2574"}
{"text":"Granted, it's still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops, my Mac boots up noticeably quicker.","id":"2351"}
{"text":"It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.","id":"526"}
{"text":"WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO!","id":"2891"}
{"text":"Couldn't keep a page up you were working on!","id":"2717"}
{"text":"It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.","id":"3020"}
{"text":"the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it.","id":"2541"}
{"text":"The Bluetooth was not there at all, and the fingerprint reader driver would be there, but the software would hang after installation was 1\/2 way done.","id":"1069"}
{"text":"Great battery, speed, display.","id":"1553"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this product to anyone.","id":"355"}
{"text":"I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.","id":"602"}
{"text":"I was given a Mac as a birthday present and couldn't be happier with it 3 years later.","id":"2502"}
{"text":"The delivery was fast, and I would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again.","id":"2874"}
{"text":"I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.","id":"2385"}
{"text":"do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one.","id":"198"}
{"text":"I'm extremely happy with my purchase as I now have the portable power I have been looking for.","id":"211"}

{"text":"That is how it is able to function better than any other PC.","id":"2650"}
{"text":"I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.","id":"392"}
{"text":"It is easy to use and lightweight.","id":"1551"}
{"text":"I went to Toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it.","id":"2698"}
{"text":"It is a bit heavy.","id":"2427"}
{"text":"\u00a0 after trying to get some help he disconnected on me.","id":"1849"}
{"text":"They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).","id":"340"}
{"text":"If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor.","id":"2918"}

{"text":"The gray color was a good choice.","id":"2415"}
{"text":"This was the second computer and brand bought that day.","id":"2730"}
{"text":"Buy this.","id":"2297"}
{"text":"VERY disappointing:","id":"2060"}
{"text":"I love this product because it is Toshiba and its 15.6\".","id":"2739"}
{"text":"I would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front.","id":"2696"}

{"text":"It seems they could have updated XP and done without creating Vista.","id":"1376"}
{"text":"\u00a0 It is easy to use, fast and has great graphics for the money.","id":"936"}
{"text":"I decided I wanted a laptop so I went into the BBY store.","id":"1627"}
{"text":"I like how the Mac OS is so simple and easy to use.","id":"2323"}

{"text":"In the three years I've had my MacBook Pro, I have never had a virus on my computer, and I do a lot of work on the internet.","id":"595"}
{"text":"I was ready to take it back for a refund, but the Geek Squad camed through and pointed me in the right direction to get it fixed.","id":"1426"}
{"text":"I have had laptops in the past and I thought why not give these small netbooks a try.","id":"2216"}
{"text":"It can't get any better.","id":"1590"}
{"text":"All the problems I have had with PC's are solved with a Mac: the issue of overheating-my Dell was always overheating and not working properly or simply shutting off, and the issue of viruses and contaminants-my HP completely quit working within2 years of purchasing it, with no inexpensive way of fixing it.","id":"1486"}
{"text":"only good thing is the graphics quality.","id":"138"}
{"text":"The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.","id":"1192"}
{"text":"In short I would never buy a Compaq again.","id":"1439"}
{"text":"I love the 15\" MacBook Pro.","id":"449"}
{"text":"breaks easily.","id":"137"}
{"text":"The paint wears off easily due to the keyboard being farther back than usual.","id":"1691"}
{"text":"That's right, no power, absolutely NOTHING.","id":"877"}
{"text":"I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was.","id":"537"}
{"text":"The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys.","id":"541"}
{"text":"But I was wrong.","id":"1291"}
{"text":"NO good.","id":"924"}
{"text":"I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.","id":"3043"}
{"text":"They sent out the box right away for me to send in my computer, they paid postage and whatnot, but when I got my computer back it still wasn't running right, and now my CD drive wasn't reading anything!","id":"505"}
{"text":"I bought this laptop Was the worst Laptop I've ever bought.","id":"431"}
{"text":"But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.","id":"569"}
{"text":"Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds.","id":"3081"}
{"text":"On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.","id":"308"}
{"text":"This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.","id":"2796"}
{"text":"Obviously one of the most important features of any computer is the \"human interface.","id":"2333"}
{"text":"Yeah, of course smarty pants \"fix it now\")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).","id":"3049"}
{"text":"The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.","id":"2660"}
{"text":"The i5 blows my desktop out of the water when it comes to rendering videos.","id":"206"}
{"text":"With a mac you don't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it's so wonderful.","id":"2138"}
{"text":"For the use it was purchased for it is a good Laptop.","id":"2737"}
{"text":"Am very glad I bought it, great netbook, low price.","id":"2392"}
{"text":"Obviously, this Macbook is P-E-R-F-E-C-T for me because it does exactly what I need in an easy-to-function way.","id":"10"}
{"text":"Worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment.","id":"85"}
{"text":"The Apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you :)","id":"9"}
{"text":"Summary: Dont buy HP.","id":"1218"}
{"text":"I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).","id":"1867"}
{"text":"The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.","id":"2377"}
{"text":"You'll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them.","id":"2438"}
{"text":"it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one.","id":"136"}
{"text":"That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.","id":"2928"}
{"text":"Macs are designed for the \"frontal lobe challenged\" people out there.","id":"258"}
{"text":"Fan vents to the side, so no cooling pad needed, great feature!","id":"2811"}
{"text":"i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.","id":"2137"}
{"text":"Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.","id":"1256"}
{"text":"It has far exceeded my expectations for power, storage, and abilitiy.","id":"1770"}
{"text":"A great feature is the spotlight search: one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword, rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document.","id":"2270"}
{"text":"My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I couldn't get online to find out why.","id":"1424"}
{"text":"I am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great!","id":"2843"}
{"text":"It is the worst laptop ever","id":"1239"}
{"text":"Suffice it to say, my MacBook Pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed.","id":"2471"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I've never really liked the Acer brand in general.","id":"1240"}
{"text":"The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!","id":"2550"}
{"text":"iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.","id":"455"}
{"text":"-I give up on my data, I just want a computer reasonably fast...","id":"641"}
{"text":"Would buy 100 more of these if I could.","id":"2197"}
{"text":"\u00a0 while it was barely a bargin in the begining, i would never purchase another dell and would not recomend the dell brand to others.","id":"1462"}
{"text":"it was shooting sparks!","id":"949"}
{"text":"Great product.","id":"2924"}
{"text":"Mac is not made for gaming.","id":"2496"}
{"text":"Well I spilled something on it and they replaced it with this model, which gets hot and the battery doesn't make it through 1 DVD.","id":"1089"}
{"text":"I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.","id":"713"}
{"text":"But Sony said we could send it back and be charged for adding the bluetooth an additional seventy something dollars.","id":"490"}
{"text":"\u00a0 By this time I was regretting ever SEEING this machine on the shelf!","id":"957"}
{"text":"Toshiba is a great brand, even though I haven't had it for a long time, I am very happy with it!","id":"2844"}
{"text":"I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently.","id":"2422"}
{"text":"the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.","id":"2540"}
{"text":"The materials that came with the computer did not include the right # anywhere.","id":"2018"}
{"text":"So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.","id":"800"}
{"text":"That day!","id":"2566"}
{"text":"\" For one, I noticed that from turning on my mac to logging on only took about 25 seconds.","id":"1683"}
{"text":"It does not even have the software to play a dvd now.","id":"2022"}
{"text":"My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple.","id":"709"}
{"text":"Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.","id":"1191"}
{"text":"Since I never really got to use this, I can't comment on anything except what went wrong after trying 2 of them.","id":"1950"}
{"text":"Buyers beware.","id":"2007"}
{"text":"HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!","id":"777"}
{"text":"Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.","id":"2775"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I'll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba.","id":"1145"}
{"text":"\u00a0 upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired.","id":"1844"}
{"text":"Windows XP SP2 caused many problems on the computer, so I had to remove it.","id":"1989"}
{"text":"Love it.","id":"2147"}
{"text":"I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.","id":"1068"}
{"text":"None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.","id":"2030"}
{"text":"Oh, it is such a great piece of equipment.","id":"2586"}
{"text":"this is my second one and the same problem, bad video card  unreliable overall, this will be my second time returning this laptop back to best buy.","id":"128"}
{"text":"I use that alot on my desktop, so I am adjusting to not having it.","id":"2822"}
{"text":"With awesome graphics and assuring security, it's perfect!","id":"1561"}
{"text":"Laptop was in new condition and operational, but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair.","id":"1890"}
{"text":"I was disappointed when I realized that the keyboard doesn't light up on this model.","id":"2435"}
{"text":"This machine was a horrible experience.","id":"826"}
{"text":"It runs perfectly.","id":"2166"}
{"text":"Very dissappointed becase I have had toshibas for years, and never a issue.","id":"739"}
{"text":"If you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac!","id":"371"}
{"text":"The laptop was very easy to set up.","id":"2969"}
{"text":"Congratulations Asus for creating one big piece of dump which is my laptop.","id":"896"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer.","id":"824"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one.","id":"2896"}
{"text":"I recommend for word processing and internet users.","id":"2754"}
{"text":"Since I've had this computer I've only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth.","id":"309"}
{"text":"\u00a0 When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.","id":"816"}
{"text":"A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.","id":"16"}
{"text":"Who couldn't love a DVD burner, 80-gigabyte HD, and fairly new graphics chip? As I soon discovered, though, there is a reason for which similarly-configured Sony and Toshiba machines cost more: they use higher-quality components that are faster, better-configured, and end up lasting a lot longer.","id":"1984"}
{"text":"falls into the case.","id":"837"}
{"text":"This is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone.","id":"1588"}
{"text":"Its fast and another thing I like is that it has three USB ports.","id":"2943"}
{"text":"Mac computers automatically \"defrag\" each time you start your computer.","id":"2410"}
{"text":"That is my only complaint!","id":"2889"}
{"text":"The salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it.","id":"1839"}
{"text":"That system is fixed.","id":"1375"}
{"text":"The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.","id":"899"}
{"text":"One of the smartest thing I did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase.","id":"2897"}
{"text":"Like the price and operation.","id":"2858"}
{"text":"The brand is tarnished in my heart.","id":"1338"}
{"text":"This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.","id":"2962"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is absolutely wonderful.","id":"1785"}
{"text":"I 'have had it for about a 1 1\/2 and yes I have had an issue with it one month out of warranty.","id":"2110"}
{"text":"I really wish I had done this years ago.","id":"2201"}
{"text":"Well, maybe I was just very unlucky.","id":"139"}
{"text":"For example, when my husband turns the light out while I'm on the computer.","id":"2582"}
{"text":"Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.","id":"35"}
{"text":"Loaded with bloatware.","id":"1041"}
{"text":"If you buy, pray you dont have major prolems.","id":"1219"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I am no Microsoft hater, I've just managed to turn into a much bigger Apple fan because of this machine.","id":"231"}
{"text":"HP refused to give me a new one and Wal Mart refused to take it back.","id":"728"}
{"text":"Within 3 weeks the same issues started happening AGAIN.","id":"1934"}
{"text":"Maximum sound isn't nearly as loud as it should be.","id":"1040"}
{"text":"Well, they don't care a bunch.","id":"178"}
{"text":"I loaded windows 7 via Bootcamp and it works flawlessly!","id":"379"}
{"text":"I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me.","id":"2358"}
{"text":"Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.","id":"1757"}
{"text":"Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough.","id":"220"}
{"text":"Recommended to people as their first laptop.","id":"2790"}
{"text":"I would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school.","id":"2370"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations.","id":"2919"}
{"text":"The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.","id":"698"}
{"text":"So what if the laptops\/mobile phones look chic and cool? The after sales support is terrible.","id":"1336"}
{"text":"they have not sent a new one nor called.","id":"797"}
{"text":"I would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend.","id":"2758"}
{"text":"I hate the display screen and I have done everything I could do the change it.","id":"146"}
{"text":"I spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare.","id":"432"}
{"text":"I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop.","id":"1969"}
{"text":"Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.","id":"2549"}
{"text":"Thinking about returning it","id":"269"}
{"text":"I gave it to my daughter because I just hated the screen, hated that it had no cd drive to at least play cd's when I wanted to listen to music and do schoolwork.","id":"469"}
{"text":"It runs very quiet too which is a plus.","id":"2974"}
{"text":"but it  has a major design flaw.","id":"835"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I took the laptop home and not even a month later, I began to have problems with it.","id":"1898"}
{"text":"It was heavy,bulky, and hard to carry because of the size.","id":"1962"}
{"text":"That was my first Apple product and since then I have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs I have bought.","id":"306"}
{"text":"i tried turning it done but it did nothing.","id":"2838"}
{"text":"It is super fast, and always loads.","id":"1666"}
{"text":"The games included are very good games.","id":"2876"}
{"text":"this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.","id":"2141"}
{"text":"I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.","id":"3040"}
{"text":"I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.","id":"2034"}
{"text":"the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.","id":"2798"}
{"text":"I just bought this laptop 3 days ago.","id":"1382"}
{"text":"I am very pleased with my purchase!","id":"2905"}
{"text":"Sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to worki","id":"2669"}
{"text":"It's super fast and a great value for the price!","id":"2895"}
{"text":"Three, the mac book has advantages over pcs' with linux based os there is very 'few problems with system performance when it comes to a mac.","id":"2181"}
{"text":"A mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense.","id":"1529"}
{"text":"Of course, eMachines cannot be made entirely to blame for this computer's woes;","id":"2002"}
{"text":"however, I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the shipping carton.","id":"1752"}
{"text":"Love it so far.","id":"672"}
{"text":"It is so much easier to use","id":"695"}
{"text":"There is no need to open a program first and the cliick open or import.","id":"2291"}
{"text":"In short, you could say your mac could become your best friend (no intention of replacing Rover your dog).","id":"2183"}
{"text":"It was a bad experience but i played down its importance.","id":"658"}
{"text":"Meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis.","id":"2286"}
{"text":"It is so nice not to worry about that and the extra expense that comes along with the necessary virus protection on PC's.","id":"2481"}
{"text":"The Notebook PC,Toshiba Qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me.","id":"1584"}
{"text":"Three weeks after I bought the netbook, the screen quit working.","id":"1893"}
{"text":"The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.","id":"2649"}
{"text":"I am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when I got back in town.","id":"783"}
{"text":"Returned laptop for a 4th repair and it came back but now would lock up and randomly reboot frequently making the laptop unusable.","id":"1889"}
{"text":"I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV.","id":"3072"}

{"text":"The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot.","id":"222"}
{"text":"I LOVE it!","id":"2802"}
{"text":"The #1 reason that is always repeated.","id":"1512"}
{"text":"Now for the hardware problems.","id":"1189"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, that is not the case.","id":"1356"}
{"text":"Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.","id":"2070"}
{"text":"It's fast and has excellent battery life.","id":"2076"}

{"text":"\u00a0 The Hewitt Packard Pavillion dv6700 was my first laptop, before this I had a Dell desktop that I loved.","id":"930"}
{"text":"Apple care included.","id":"612"}
{"text":"It was an all around waste of money for me.","id":"470"}
{"text":"I worked in IT retail sales before.","id":"1320"}
{"text":"Features like the font are very block-like and old school.","id":"2706"}
{"text":"It has everything you need to get the job done.","id":"2997"}
{"text":"It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user, that makes it run way to slow.","id":"2954"}
{"text":"I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plastic\u00a0pieces\u00a0would come off of it.","id":"1874"}
{"text":"it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once.","id":"2834"}
{"text":"Finally, I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time.","id":"1546"}
{"text":"This laptop has left me with a HORRIBLE taste in my mouth for Acer brand products.","id":"1939"}
{"text":"its not bad just VERY VERY annoying.","id":"2840"}
{"text":"Well, maybe more like week one.","id":"484"}
{"text":"Windows is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs.","id":"2003"}
{"text":"After sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish, I broke down and spent another $100 to get Microsoft Word for Mac.","id":"1180"}

{"text":"DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS HORRIBLE.","id":"809"}
{"text":"then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.","id":"799"}
{"text":"The only bad part is the size\/weight.","id":"1668"}
{"text":"The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop.","id":"274"}
{"text":"I liked the aluminum body.","id":"2128"}
{"text":"also it is light weight compared to others.","id":"2237"}
{"text":"Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or watching movies.","id":"2456"}
{"text":"From the build quality to the performance, everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple.","id":"353"}
{"text":"I love the dock where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program, and the program will simply open that file.","id":"2290"}
{"text":"Sorry, newegg.","id":"1121"}
{"text":"Be safe buy a Sony.","id":"134"}
{"text":"pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.","id":"347"}
{"text":"Originally bought it for my wife.","id":"1813"}
{"text":"It was truly a great computer costing less than one thousand bucks before tax.","id":"655"}
{"text":"Waiting for the i7 was well worth it, great value for the price.","id":"2510"}
{"text":"I bought this laptop on Saturday and am completely in love with it!","id":"1615"}
{"text":"I  asked how they would determine that since there are no scratches, dents  or other signs of damage and was told that was the only way this type of  damage could happen.","id":"844"}
{"text":"Now,,,,,my monitor has been acting up for about 2 months.","id":"884"}
{"text":"Also, the extended warranty was a problem.","id":"2785"}
{"text":"Boots up fast and runs great!","id":"2443"}
{"text":"Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!","id":"81"}
{"text":"Buy it, love it, and I promise you won't regret it.","id":"89"}
{"text":"I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $50 for it.","id":"2114"}
{"text":"If you don't like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you.","id":"1670"}
{"text":"Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.","id":"764"}
{"text":"Just a month and a half or two months ago, my VAIO crashed again.","id":"525"}
{"text":"They sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didn't work.","id":"435"}
{"text":"\u00a0A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.","id":"914"}
{"text":"I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am.","id":"177"}
{"text":"The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.","id":"1776"}
{"text":"The 13\" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable.","id":"330"}
{"text":"I should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer.","id":"865"}
{"text":"Great overall.","id":"1791"}
{"text":"My smart phone is faster!","id":"549"}
{"text":"They say sorry out of warranty.","id":"1212"}
{"text":"I have full control at all times of what is going on - there is no control+alt+delete business anymore.","id":"2169"}
{"text":"I bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio.","id":"2845"}
{"text":"PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed.","id":"756"}
{"text":"After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years, I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek design and promise of less tech issues.","id":"2600"}
{"text":"I have a laptop as my regular computer, but found that disconnecting it and lugging it around was a drag.","id":"2327"}
{"text":"This is my second MacBook.","id":"3012"}
{"text":"The size is perfect and I do not recomend anything bigger except for any person who can exceed the limited space it gives you.","id":"1696"}
{"text":"The service I received from Toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty.","id":"1479"}
{"text":"Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed, etc.","id":"2909"}
{"text":"I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.","id":"2937"}
{"text":"I own other Macs but always find myself navigation to the MacBook Pro to get my work done.","id":"1784"}
{"text":"There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.","id":"453"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd Apple Laptop and first MacBook Pro.","id":"439"}
{"text":"I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.","id":"2925"}
{"text":"The love part of my relationship with this laptop doesn't take very long.","id":"929"}
{"text":"Not enough time for me to give it 5 stars!","id":"2804"}
{"text":"The screen shows great colors.","id":"2077"}
{"text":"Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.","id":"2622"}
{"text":"That's a huge difference.","id":"1093"}
{"text":"Dells are ok, HPs aren't that good, but Macs or Fantastic.","id":"225"}
{"text":"\u00a0 So, buyers beware!","id":"1100"}
{"text":"I am totally satisfied with my little toshie!","id":"2523"}
{"text":"I have no idea how to burn cd's or to use the web cam, just for starters.","id":"970"}
{"text":"Again, I sent it off to Acer, by this time they were paying for me to send it to them and everything, but it was still inconvienent because of my classes and my communication with my fiance.","id":"1935"}
{"text":"DEFINITELY recommended!!!","id":"11"}
{"text":"It is extremely user friendly and intuitive.","id":"2569"}
{"text":"Let me start with the good:So awesome.","id":"3010"}
{"text":"I had finally reached my limit and broke down.","id":"1634"}
{"text":"The 17 inch screen is very large, but the computer is very light.","id":"2414"}
{"text":"\u00a0 My opinion of Sony has been dropping as fast as the stock market, given their horrible support, but this machine just caused another plunge.","id":"832"}
{"text":"Do I like the computer? Well, other than not getting viruses, I guess it is OK.","id":"1205"}
{"text":"For the Bluetooth to work properly, you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers\/Applications DVD, or it will not show after the reload.","id":"1064"}
{"text":"I waited and waited and no laptop.","id":"2037"}
{"text":"Everything is falling apart internally and externally.","id":"1429"}
{"text":"I also liked the glass screen.","id":"2130"}
{"text":"The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.","id":"2626"}
{"text":"It super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.","id":"1671"}
{"text":"It's not a wear-and-tear issue, not due to user carelessness and most importantly, they CAN'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for service and I have to accept the outcome.","id":"1315"}
{"text":"The battery life has not decreased since I bought it, so i'm thrilled with that.","id":"2756"}
{"text":"Its a dog plain and simple.","id":"548"}
{"text":"When I called Toshiba, they would not do anything and even tried to charge me $35 for the phone call, even though they didn't offer any technical support.","id":"1446"}
{"text":"My HP is very heavy.","id":"168"}
{"text":"I bought this notebook and only had it for 3 months If it is overload with updates the BOOT MGR.","id":"922"}
{"text":"Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.","id":"2797"}
{"text":"The price and features more than met my needs.","id":"2863"}
{"text":"They refuse.","id":"638"}
{"text":"big mistake!","id":"2642"}
{"text":"Best Buy was great as always and accepted the return and gave me another model 1764.","id":"1000"}
{"text":"and dell and best buy both refused to take it back after i only had it for 1 hour....","id":"200"}
{"text":"My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA!","id":"2887"}
{"text":"First of all, I've been Dell fan for more than fifteen years.","id":"993"}
{"text":"GREAT INVESTMENT!","id":"2464"}
{"text":"I am just amazed.","id":"1667"}
{"text":"I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.","id":"416"}
{"text":"I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and I wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.","id":"2041"}
{"text":"Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.","id":"240"}
{"text":"I would buy this lap top over and over again!","id":"2135"}
{"text":"the mouse buttons are hard to push.","id":"1393"}
{"text":"I can actually get work done with this MAC, and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop.","id":"2259"}
{"text":"Also, HDD secures inside using rails, and there is only one set on the main hard drive.","id":"1080"}
{"text":"If you're not wanting to be mobile, this is a good laptop to sit on a desk.","id":"2695"}
{"text":"I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.","id":"1506"}
{"text":"Just don't waste your time and money on this.","id":"1837"}
{"text":"All I will say now is that it was over two grand less expensive and so much better quality than my hunk of crap Vaio.","id":"532"}
{"text":"(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is.","id":"3047"}
{"text":"And I'm still paying the bloody financing, for a product which didn't last me at least three years !","id":"921"}
{"text":"Games being the main issue.","id":"1733"}
{"text":"No problems, no lock ups, no disappointments.","id":"2907"}
{"text":"While the computer seems to be set up in a common sense way rather than in geek-speak, there are certain quirks that can drive you crazy trying to deal with the PC world.","id":"1178"}
{"text":"I am definitely sold, and not going back to PCs for home use!","id":"2265"}
{"text":"I have a lapdesk which I can use, but I can still feel the heat through the foam and plastic.","id":"119"}
{"text":"and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it.","id":"68"}
{"text":"It was over rated!","id":"2746"}
{"text":"I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.","id":"282"}
{"text":"My sister has the same Mac as me and she is in a band and uses GarageBand to record and edit.","id":"1532"}
{"text":"I wasn't really sure I wanted to spend that kind of money!","id":"2800"}
{"text":"Other Thoughts: Do not purchase this product.","id":"1042"}
{"text":"They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive (I don't really understand why but anyway).","id":"640"}
{"text":"and looks very sexyy:D  really the mac book pro is the best laptop specially for students in college if you are not caring about price.","id":"2238"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I took the computer back in yet again except this time they kept it to send into their Geek Squad headquarters.","id":"1907"}
{"text":"This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone.","id":"78"}
{"text":"Thank God for \"ctrl Z\"Bottom line, I've been using laptops since the mid 90s and probably the majority of brands out there.","id":"891"}
{"text":"They definitely have a superior product!","id":"692"}
{"text":"A great computer for light home use and business use.","id":"1580"}
{"text":"Bought it to use mostly for oline classes.","id":"2817"}
{"text":"Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.","id":"273"}
{"text":"Also consider the MS Office apps are all trial versions, hope you have your own copies.","id":"2679"}
{"text":"They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.","id":"415"}
{"text":"This computer was awful!","id":"2046"}
{"text":"Heck, if I had enough ' money, I would but it as a gift for someone.","id":"2450"}
{"text":"Even so, I like playing online games, so it was wonderful that there is a feature where I can dualboot Windows.","id":"2170"}
{"text":"The battery life is amazingly long at 7hrs and 5hrs if you use it.","id":"2624"}
{"text":"My previous purchases were with Dell and HP.","id":"1822"}
{"text":"I have not have any problems.","id":"2374"}
{"text":"I purchased an HP right after my high school graduation.","id":"1896"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend bought the Gateway NV78 in nov of 09.","id":"341"}
{"text":"It is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all.","id":"2245"}
{"text":"lightweight, long battery life, excellent transition from PC;","id":"1569"}
{"text":"The price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop.","id":"3064"}
{"text":"The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year.","id":"2953"}
{"text":"It is stamped and not in pieces therefore it is a stronger more resilient frame.","id":"2129"}
{"text":"I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers.","id":"2075"}
{"text":"Two, owning a 17 in.mac book gives the flexibility to sit anywhere you want without worry about bother anyone.","id":"2180"}
{"text":"Sent unit back and it's been two months.","id":"1362"}
{"text":"Came fully loaded - good.","id":"2710"}
{"text":"I noticed windows has a new system called Windows 7, what about us Vista users?\u00a0 They should get all the bugs out of Vista before investing in a new system.","id":"1373"}
{"text":"When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec. of 2008, we wanted Windows XP, but were told it would cost an extra $159, so we went with Vista.","id":"1370"}
{"text":"(I definatly can't).","id":"1697"}
{"text":"Files as well would become lost, deleted or corrupted.","id":"276"}
{"text":"It is meant to be PORTABLE.","id":"1287"}
{"text":"My laptop worked again for just a while before I started having issues AGAIN.","id":"1929"}
{"text":"This is perfect for her field.","id":"2365"}
{"text":"taking it back less than 24 hours of purchase","id":"412"}
{"text":"That's the downside for me.","id":"2742"}
{"text":"The only thing that I have, is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters, would help if it was a little lighter then it is.","id":"1758"}
{"text":"Hopefully Amazon will take this back.","id":"1257"}
{"text":"\u00a0 They ended up keeping my computer for almost 3 months!","id":"1908"}
{"text":"I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair \"depot\"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not  covered.","id":"842"}
{"text":"\u00a0 But I needed a laptop for school use.","id":"931"}
{"text":"he can't stand it.","id":"863"}
{"text":"The computer was delivered as promised.","id":"2151"}
{"text":"This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.","id":"36"}
{"text":"I would like at least a 4 hr. battery life.","id":"2967"}
{"text":"The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to.","id":"1732"}
{"text":"Looking online, many people are having the same problem.","id":"1800"}
{"text":"Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.","id":"1063"}
{"text":"THIS IS MY SECOND MAC BOOK PRO.","id":"2615"}
{"text":"MacBook Notebooks quickly die out because of their short battery life, as well as the many background programs that run without the user's knowlede.","id":"271"}
{"text":"All the things you can do with the trackpad make navigating around the computer and its programs so much simpler, quicker, and easier.","id":"2478"}
{"text":"I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.","id":"523"}
{"text":"Theres a built in camera with special effects- for video and photography.","id":"1657"}
{"text":"All for such a great price.","id":"1674"}
{"text":"I went right out and purchased another laptop.","id":"472"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.","id":"1143"}
{"text":"I am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it.","id":"2618"}
{"text":"I already own an iPhone, and so the move just made more sense.","id":"1708"}
{"text":"So think about factoring those things in when you purchase.","id":"2771"}
{"text":"Took the netbook on a vacation trip and I was able to do whatever I wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop.","id":"2375"}
{"text":"Everything was up and running within 15 minutes of unboxing.","id":"203"}
{"text":"This computer gets very hot, before shutting down.","id":"123"}
{"text":"Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.","id":"2927"}
{"text":"\u00a0Went silently.","id":"916"}
{"text":"Satisfy what I paid for it.","id":"2750"}
{"text":"IT IS TRASH!","id":"1137"}
{"text":"It has good speed and plenty of hard drive space.","id":"2993"}
{"text":"Clear picture on it and everything.","id":"2453"}
{"text":"Overall though, for the money spent it's a great deal.","id":"2661"}
{"text":"So you don't get frustrated the first few weeks.","id":"2590"}
{"text":"They said that my computer was covered on an extended warranty, and that products with\u00a0 extended warranties are taken care of through third parties and not Sony itself anymore.","id":"515"}
{"text":"It's so useable and responsive.","id":"2321"}
{"text":"It is truly a Desktop Replacement.","id":"2282"}
{"text":"I only used it to browse the internet and and I dont know how many times it has spontaniously shut down and it is just a blank screen now.","id":"1135"}
{"text":"A little pricey but it is well, well worth it.","id":"1577"}

{"text":"I've had the MacBook Pro 15 for about three weeks, and it really is a great computer.","id":"2484"}

{"text":"It was definelty a smart move.","id":"1609"}

{"text":"The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter.","id":"1233"}
{"text":"you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.","id":"2231"}
{"text":"Excellent speed for processing data.","id":"2828"}
{"text":"All in all, I'm incredibly dissatisfied with this laptop, and with HP as a whole.","id":"121"}

{"text":"I tried out another Mac for a few months before buying this one and it is a great machine.","id":"2094"}
{"text":"Somehow the system clock got messed up after reboot.","id":"1252"}
{"text":"the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb RAM, the computer was kinda slow.","id":"3007"}
{"text":"With the macbook pro it comes with freesecuritysoftware to protect it from viruses and other intrusive things from downloads and internet surfing or emails.","id":"1650"}
{"text":"The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue.","id":"1229"}
{"text":"I visited the Apple Store and was impressed with the 17-inch MacBook Pro.","id":"399"}
{"text":"The driver updates don't fix the issue, very frustrating.","id":"1037"}
{"text":"I will never go back to Windows!","id":"1620"}
{"text":"Do your research on this issue.","id":"1035"}
{"text":"Looking to take my video and photo editing to the next level, I decided to purchase the MBP 15in Intel Core i5 after reading consumer reviews as well as professional reviews of this laptop.","id":"201"}

{"text":"But you must get the 15 inch.","id":"2133"}
{"text":"i will be returning it and switching brands when i get to best buy.","id":"131"}
{"text":"Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan","id":"1364"}
{"text":"Overall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.","id":"2787"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The casing of the power cord fried and shocked my husband when he pulled it out of the socket.","id":"948"}

{"text":"Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.","id":"767"}
{"text":"After the first few months, the computer started crashing about every week.","id":"1990"}
{"text":"My son and his family have a hard time financially because he is self-employed so the family had no computer of any kind, and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school.","id":"2366"}
{"text":"It's a great product for a great price!","id":"2988"}
{"text":"Again, the same problem, the right speaker did not work.","id":"1385"}
{"text":"But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.","id":"1646"}
{"text":"Before i bought my new i5, I did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for HP to Apple for reliability, dependable, and long lasting operations.","id":"88"}
{"text":"Dell wanted to charge us for everything everytime I called them with a problem.","id":"1270"}
{"text":"THIS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT.","id":"1834"}
{"text":"i have\u00a0had my dell latitude for almost three years.","id":"1451"}
{"text":"May be better for the occasional web surfer.","id":"55"}

{"text":"This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.","id":"768"}
{"text":"Obviously we both got new Macs.","id":"2559"}
{"text":"My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect, unlike the PCs in our lives.","id":"242"}

{"text":"Not super fancy, but not super expensive either.","id":"2908"}
{"text":"Keyboard good sized and wasy to use.","id":"214"}
{"text":"HP said it was out of warranty.","id":"1263"}
{"text":"-Stay away from Apple, or hope you laptop does not break down.","id":"650"}
{"text":"It's a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs.","id":"2703"}
{"text":"I never had this kind of quality issue with Dell (not to say Dell is that great), not with a brand new laptop.","id":"142"}
{"text":"wonderful features.","id":"2947"}
{"text":"the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run.","id":"66"}
{"text":"I had to call HP and ask for a recovery disk because the computer does not come with one and completely redo it all.","id":"2020"}
{"text":"Im glad that it has such great features in it.","id":"2451"}
{"text":"it's just a great toy to have around.","id":"605"}

{"text":"It is not ideal for children because of the temp.","id":"124"}
{"text":"sounds like a typewriter, but if you can get past that, this is a great laptop for a little money!","id":"2816"}
{"text":"\u00a0 When this happened I would have to completely power off my computer and restart it.","id":"1900"}
{"text":"Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.","id":"732"}
{"text":"Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.","id":"3011"}
{"text":"I or my dad paid over twenty four hundred dollars for everything.","id":"485"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.","id":"1842"}

{"text":"I'm going back to PC.","id":"1160"}
{"text":"Great, quick laptop for the money.","id":"2989"}
{"text":"although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.","id":"1398"}
{"text":"\u00a0 We have had numerous problems with Vista, such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled, Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on, also, the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times, the same update.","id":"1372"}
{"text":"The Dell mini was the first Dell product that I had ever purchased.","id":"467"}
{"text":"with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.","id":"1400"}

{"text":"One more tip, please purchase this model and get a 4GB stick of RAM to save you $10","id":"1066"}
{"text":"By week two, my laptop had overheated and was completely dead even though I did not use it too much.","id":"1607"}
{"text":"And it is impossible to get them back in.","id":"910"}
{"text":"My last laptop gave me a constant battle even though it was also completely new.","id":"2379"}
{"text":"I have been a mac user since the mid 90s.","id":"361"}
{"text":"It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!","id":"344"}
{"text":"\u00a0 After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq.","id":"1368"}
{"text":"Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.","id":"2038"}
{"text":"It doesn't heat up like my old laptop.","id":"1673"}
{"text":"I always have used a tower home PC and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance.","id":"2871"}
{"text":"It's solid.","id":"2530"}
{"text":"Before I got my macbook, I owned a Dell laptop.","id":"1603"}
{"text":"This laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery I have owned outside of the Iphone.","id":"381"}
{"text":"The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.","id":"312"}
{"text":"At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.","id":"2795"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Until I bought the Dell, I thought you just looked for what you wanted (size, software, options, hardware) and purchase the best deal you could find.","id":"1865"}
{"text":"I don't know how I could ever live without my Qousmio.","id":"1681"}
{"text":"It has plenty of memory, lots of hard drive, and great graphics.","id":"2973"}
{"text":"It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.","id":"2612"}
{"text":"\u00a0 It lasted for many years of travel, kids and abuse and if I fired it up today, it would work.","id":"1864"}
{"text":"been a PC user for many, many years.","id":"2629"}
{"text":"I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far, and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it.","id":"2207"}
{"text":"It freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.","id":"249"}
{"text":"However, my girlfriend realized that the netbook's hinge is a bit loose (when you open or close the LCD).","id":"1283"}
{"text":"My problem was with DELL Customer Service.","id":"1423"}
{"text":"There are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!","id":"288"}
{"text":"It is not even a year old yet, so I would\u00a0definitely not recommend it to anyone.","id":"256"}
{"text":"Amazing machine.","id":"2280"}
{"text":"I don't do any high tech stuff on it, just write papers, check mail, and sometimes play games, so I can't reccomend it if you are in the computer field.","id":"322"}
{"text":"Newegg's RMA service was great as always, I contacted them late Friday night, and they issued me an RMA number and a PrePaid UPS shipping label the very next morning on Saturday.","id":"1072"}
{"text":"I'm very impressed.","id":"2826"}
{"text":"Dell sucks","id":"1390"}
{"text":"Design: very durable.","id":"1739"}
{"text":"It is easy to go from one keyboard to another.","id":"2419"}
{"text":"I spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person!","id":"785"}
{"text":"The Mac Book Pro performs flawlessly.","id":"82"}
{"text":"Has a 5-6 hour battery life.","id":"1549"}
{"text":"My ONLY issues are: 1) the screen\/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60","id":"2086"}
{"text":"I run Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro 7, Photoshop, Safari, Firefox, MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.","id":"300"}
{"text":"I have owned many computers and laptops.","id":"262"}
{"text":"I recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it!","id":"2521"}
{"text":"Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.","id":"2284"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.","id":"851"}
{"text":"Ive had to call tech support many times.","id":"1008"}
{"text":"The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)!","id":"2261"}
{"text":"Yes, I have it on the highest available setting.","id":"2793"}
{"text":"Not to mention it has shit gigs.","id":"291"}
{"text":"Hieroglyphics are quite common.","id":"1185"}
{"text":"This worked just fine.","id":"1719"}
{"text":"I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen, as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners.","id":"391"}
{"text":"Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing, uploading photos, watching movies (720p) on occasion and creating presentations.","id":"1595"}
{"text":"I was so happy with my new Mac.","id":"1150"}
{"text":"Quality Display  I love HP,, it's the only computer\/printer we will buy.","id":"2362"}
{"text":"Despite the inconvenient weight, I opted for the 12 cell battery.","id":"116"}
{"text":"My MacBook is faster than any comparable PC.","id":"2119"}
{"text":"The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.","id":"2647"}
{"text":"I'm very happy with this machine!","id":"2108"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this company or their products!!!!","id":"789"}
{"text":"I like this machine because its very lightweight...","id":"570"}
{"text":"\u00a0    First it burned or fused the power adapter plug.","id":"980"}
{"text":"the features are great, the only thing it needs is better speakers.","id":"668"}
{"text":"It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.","id":"1106"}
{"text":"I bought this laptop and found its TAB is not functioning.","id":"140"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought Toshiba will do nothing about it.","id":"1418"}
{"text":"HP said I had done the damage.","id":"539"}
{"text":"-Called headquarters again, they report that TFT panel is broken, should be fixed by the end of the week (week 3).","id":"621"}
{"text":"Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.","id":"2360"}
{"text":"I would recommend this product.","id":"2397"}
{"text":"If I had to buy another computer, I would most definetly buy an acer one computer.","id":"2449"}
{"text":"The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.","id":"1126"}
{"text":"Though the picture, video, and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to (CS5) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers.","id":"1745"}
{"text":"I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop.","id":"2205"}
{"text":"Everything else just install and go.","id":"1065"}
{"text":"\u00a0 This thing is a lemon.","id":"987"}
{"text":"My laptop is almost 2yrs old and I have never had any problems with it.","id":"363"}
{"text":"All the customers that come in hate Dell.","id":"1276"}
{"text":"We now own two of these, identical.","id":"2911"}
{"text":"I've already recommended this laptop to a friend who eye'd the computer when I took it out of my bag.","id":"2714"}
{"text":"I enjoy very much my new Toshiba, purchased specifially for attending online schooling.","id":"2900"}
{"text":"Once you go Mac, you can't go back!","id":"2177"}
{"text":"I brought this laptop last friday, and originally it worked fantastic.","id":"164"}
{"text":"The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.","id":"39"}
{"text":"The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.","id":"3019"}
{"text":"They're easy, fun, powerful and will last a long time.","id":"1517"}
{"text":"I WANT MY L505-s5988 BACK!","id":"1090"}
{"text":"I let my friend borrow it, and she knows nothing about computers, and she used it with ease.","id":"1678"}
{"text":"This MacBook is an outstanding product with great value.","id":"2469"}
{"text":"If that is the case for you, I would suggest a pull-behind solution when looking at cases.","id":"2429"}
{"text":"I had to re-install Windows within two weeks of the purchase and soon discovered cracks in the screen hinges.","id":"1986"}
{"text":"A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE.","id":"1088"}
{"text":"and plenty of storage with 250 gb(though I will upgrade this and the ram..)","id":"678"}
{"text":"I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.","id":"417"}
{"text":"No temporary replacement, they are out of replacements because \"many computers had problems with the Nvidia chipset\"-Inquired status of repair.","id":"625"}
{"text":"I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.","id":"2035"}
{"text":"I respond that I do not have the old computer...","id":"636"}
{"text":"I homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat.","id":"1808"}
{"text":"Programs would crash all the time, and it turned out to be a very unstable, unreliable laptop for me.","id":"1921"}
{"text":"I BOUGHT THIS LAP TOP AND THE CHARGE TIME DOSEN'T LAST AS LONG AS THEY SAY IT WILL MORE LIKE 2 HOURS","id":"1872"}
{"text":"Also, because of the size and consistancy of the laptop computer, some websites wouldn't even attempt to work on the computer because of browser problems.","id":"1413"}
{"text":"I work with kids and they love making short videos on there.","id":"369"}
{"text":"It is very durable, I am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet.","id":"321"}
{"text":"the key bindings take a little getting used to, but have loved the Macbook Pro.","id":"2636"}
{"text":"Keyboard is reasonable size.","id":"357"}
{"text":"Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky.","id":"1230"}
{"text":"I'm now trying to decide on another Dell model.","id":"1006"}
{"text":"I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would.","id":"3075"}
{"text":"The Macbook is a fantastic laptop.","id":"216"}
{"text":"Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.","id":"3045"}
{"text":"I believe this is because I was more active than the average user, meaning I average about three \"tabs\".","id":"1688"}
{"text":"Best Buy Rocks!","id":"2098"}
{"text":"A couple things you should know:","id":"1877"}
{"text":"bought the first asus laptop in san francisco, returned it in santa maria, thinking it was just a problem with that computer.","id":"129"}
{"text":"The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.","id":"235"}
{"text":"It has a .1 ghz faster processor and a stock 500gb hard drive.","id":"3055"}
{"text":"The feature are good enough for what I need.","id":"2865"}
{"text":"All the yada-yada.","id":"1300"}
{"text":"Finally, the biggest problem has been tech support.","id":"1197"}
{"text":"this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures.","id":"2538"}
{"text":"I had the computer for a full year and it was a new computer.","id":"1403"}
{"text":"\" This isn't a big deal, I haven't noticed the issue with DVDs or other media, only through USB output.","id":"2676"}
{"text":"I love it!","id":"75"}
{"text":"With Windows laptops a wireless mouse is an absolute must.","id":"2319"}
{"text":"(I had been a Windows\/Linux user before this) I love the size because the screen is big enough for what I use it for (Internet, artwork), and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable.","id":"452"}
{"text":"But if you're willing to pay another 200 dollar for a windows disc.","id":"2498"}
{"text":"Very good quality and well made.","id":"2515"}
{"text":"I bought a Logitech desktop set in anticipation for using with the MBP, but I use the touchpad 90% of the time.","id":"2320"}
{"text":"When calling Dell for help, reurn, or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it.","id":"2051"}
{"text":"Two of the times was in one month.","id":"1017"}
{"text":"So needless to day, I'm not happy.","id":"971"}
{"text":"my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.","id":"3083"}
{"text":"Although I was promised about 10 hours, I found myself to a limited 7 hours (which is still amazing).","id":"1687"}
{"text":"It had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one.","id":"2593"}
{"text":"It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me.","id":"1507"}
{"text":"Typically, when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience.","id":"336"}
{"text":"Consumer Report recommended Toshiba.","id":"2391"}
{"text":"Needless to say I told them No and have a nice day and hung up!","id":"786"}
{"text":"It was super easy to set up and Is really easy to get used to.","id":"1616"}
{"text":"The only thing that can be updated is the video, other than that you're all set.","id":"1062"}
{"text":"It wasn't worth it.","id":"1982"}
{"text":"Its a good laptop for its value.","id":"2704"}
{"text":"ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.","id":"2930"}
{"text":"Probbly the worst decision we ever made!","id":"343"}
{"text":"Then the hard drive failed;","id":"1152"}
{"text":"\u00a0 This computer literally takes about five minutes to start up and to be able to use without it crawling and I DO mean crawling.","id":"1868"}
{"text":"I had less problems.","id":"1353"}
{"text":"It will be returned in the state to which it was shipped Michigan.","id":"977"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.","id":"2747"}
{"text":"This machine rocks!","id":"2102"}
{"text":"of course my warranty runs out next month.","id":"967"}
{"text":"My next laptop will also be a Mac!","id":"1774"}
{"text":"But not in this case.","id":"1685"}
{"text":"taking notes, research, an online class and such and didn't want to spend too much on my first machine.","id":"932"}
{"text":"The capabilities using that program alone made me want a Mac.","id":"2501"}
{"text":"When I got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school, I had a hard time from beginning.","id":"1873"}
{"text":"I do not know for sure.","id":"1753"}
{"text":"No machine has come remotely close to causing as many problems.","id":"892"}
{"text":"Every single one we've gotten we've had problems with.","id":"1241"}
{"text":"it is the worst computer dell ever made.","id":"135"}

{"text":"for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is.","id":"2300"}
{"text":"Heck, I like all Mac computers, but they're all WAY too pricey for the kind of economy the U.S. is going through.","id":"373"}
{"text":"\u00a0Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I'd have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty.","id":"1420"}
{"text":"They claim that I should be happy because I am getting a new laptop to replace my two-month old laptop.","id":"643"}
{"text":"I'm already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown.","id":"2346"}
{"text":"The machine itself is alright.","id":"1326"}
{"text":"It seems to have some opions that are intalled but do not work like I thought they would.","id":"2951"}
{"text":"And having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare.","id":"433"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the warranty expires and researching carefully when I do so I don't run accross a situation like this again!","id":"968"}
{"text":"I also experience the same with my MacBook Air.","id":"420"}
{"text":"It has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer.","id":"1764"}
{"text":"I have owned many different brands of laptops in my life.","id":"1860"}
{"text":"I did an internet search and this is a very common problem with this  laptop.","id":"847"}
{"text":"I've owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.","id":"2718"}
{"text":"It did fairly well, other than it's poor performance, overheating and occational blue screen.","id":"995"}
{"text":"The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!","id":"2219"}
{"text":"tons of bloatware and junk programs.","id":"607"}
{"text":"its sad because their commercials are great.","id":"802"}
{"text":"lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small.","id":"610"}
{"text":"Luckily, Dell said they would replace my laptop with a new one, but instead I got a refund and bought a mac.","id":"1608"}
{"text":"I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.","id":"284"}
{"text":"Never been hacked.","id":"1525"}
{"text":"It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.","id":"3030"}
{"text":"Good keyboard, long battery life, largest hard drive and windows 7.","id":"687"}
{"text":"I think it was seventy nine plus tax.","id":"521"}
{"text":"In summary, take your money elsewhere.","id":"64"}
{"text":"The processor is very quick and effective as I load webpages and applications.","id":"388"}
{"text":"My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!","id":"520"}
{"text":"I will NEVER buy (Refurbished) again, I don't cae how cheap it is.","id":"1835"}
{"text":"It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.","id":"2610"}
{"text":"\u00a0 It is just slow slow slow.","id":"1870"}
{"text":"Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.","id":"2089"}
{"text":"As a lifelong Windows user, I was extremely pleased to make the change to Mac.","id":"2266"}
{"text":"So, owing to these problems, I went out and got myself an Apple MacBook Pro, which I am using with great satisfaction at this very moment.","id":"1998"}
{"text":"The Macbook Pro is extremely thin and light compared to those heavy Windows Laptop.","id":"2623"}
{"text":"So this was great for me.","id":"1503"}
{"text":"This is the first macbook I have ever had.","id":"217"}
{"text":"The acer one compuer is a great computer.","id":"2445"}
{"text":"another problem.","id":"960"}
{"text":"The Macbook is also made better, my computer has never got a virus, and the laptop runs just as fast as the first day I bought it.","id":"1710"}
{"text":"So, if you're thinking of a laptop, I would heartily recommend theApple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook for all your needs!","id":"2613"}
{"text":"I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price.","id":"1543"}
{"text":"Overall I feel this netbook was poor quality, had poor performance, although it did have great battery life when it did work.","id":"1895"}
{"text":"I picked it out because it was inexpensive ($400) and I thought it would be a good, easy to use first laptop.","id":"1604"}
{"text":"MY ONLY PROBLEM IS I CAN NOT REG. THE PRODUCT KEY.","id":"1698"}
{"text":"The \"Time remaining\" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.","id":"3028"}
{"text":"Pay attention to the specs if you want these options.","id":"2437"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Stupidly, mind-numbingly slow--then I found it can only be loaded with 2GB *maximum*.","id":"829"}
{"text":"It also does not have bluetooth.","id":"2436"}
{"text":"Sure it has the one touch keys but that was the best feature of the computer.","id":"1968"}
{"text":"I can do pretty much 75% of what I do on my desktop on my kitchen table.","id":"1807"}
{"text":"Being a PC user my whole life....","id":"673"}
{"text":"great battery life.","id":"356"}
{"text":"The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.","id":"2486"}
{"text":"At first, the computer seemed a great deal--seemingly high-end specs for a low, low price.","id":"1983"}
{"text":"Delivery was early too.","id":"2637"}
{"text":"During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.","id":"2028"}
{"text":"Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro, this thing holds its own.","id":"2648"}
{"text":"Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.","id":"2531"}
{"text":"And that probably explains why I've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it.","id":"1798"}
{"text":"I left the place angrily.","id":"1323"}
{"text":"I my wife is also now the proud owner of a Macbook as well!","id":"1711"}
{"text":"I've had a Toshiba laptop in the past;","id":"2670"}
{"text":"It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).","id":"334"}
{"text":"ASUS said my net-book was working properly.","id":"1884"}
{"text":"I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.","id":"2794"}
{"text":"Very annoying.","id":"1991"}
{"text":"My main reason to convert was the imovie program.","id":"1706"}
{"text":"It has a faster processor and more ram.","id":"547"}
{"text":"If you need an affordable, entry-level laptop, this will fit the bill.","id":"2688"}
{"text":"Laptops are usually used on the go, so why not give you a better battery?","id":"2977"}
{"text":"I will never complain about the price since I believe you get what you pay for and my MacBook Pro was worth every dollar.","id":"1724"}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan of the Netbooks but this one was very well designed.","id":"2592"}
{"text":"It may take a little getting used to but you don't have to worry about viruses or other headaches.","id":"365"}
{"text":"And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.","id":"1651"}
{"text":"I still have that stupid bluetooth mouse to!","id":"533"}
{"text":"Would like more trendy, high tech features.","id":"2707"}
{"text":"Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.","id":"444"}
{"text":"Screen is a bit glossy, but that's not too bad.","id":"1792"}
{"text":"Received the product promptly and without any issues.","id":"2240"}
{"text":"It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!","id":"1663"}
{"text":"I remind myself from time to time to take off my watch when ever I look at the small scratch that it has caused.","id":"1693"}
{"text":"I got it back again and was told the motherboard had been replaced, so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months.","id":"1933"}
{"text":"But reasons we chose this Apple computer.","id":"2126"}
{"text":"Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v\/s 2.4 GHz).","id":"3041"}
{"text":"They say it could be the motherboard again, but Dell","id":"1349"}
{"text":"I upgraded from a 5 year old laptop and was amazed to find out that this computer is much slower then my old laptop.","id":"546"}
{"text":"2nd Best computer in the world  only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches  to make less easier for people to hack into","id":"2490"}
{"text":"Love the speed, especially!","id":"1713"}
{"text":"It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.","id":"1075"}
{"text":"Not only are the versions of these programs able to be saved, worked on and opened on both a PC and Mac, the versions of these programs on a Mac are graphically and functionally superior.","id":"2509"}
{"text":"By Air sounds more like by truck to Me.","id":"1231"}
{"text":"\u00a0 So far it has been five months since the last problem was fixed and I am PRAYING it has finally stopped.","id":"966"}
{"text":"It's outstanding too.","id":"1274"}
{"text":"The speed gives you the power to work on these projects seamlessly, and multiple at a time if you sowish.","id":"2155"}
{"text":"Awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college.","id":"377"}
{"text":"So I'm disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority.","id":"2767"}
{"text":"\u00a0A MONTH LATER, we reinstall the OS (Vista).","id":"913"}
{"text":"Some problems can be fixed if you purchase new software, but there is no guarentee.","id":"1379"}
{"text":"My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.","id":"3024"}
{"text":"just chill and enjoy.","id":"567"}
{"text":"The battery life is also relatively good.","id":"2159"}
{"text":"It is her first laptop and she is thrilled.","id":"1594"}
{"text":"I should have sent it back to them then.","id":"869"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I definitely suggest getting an extended warranty, you will probably need it!","id":"940"}
{"text":"If this would be your first Mac purchase then I would highly suggest that you take advantage of the class that they offer to learn about the differences between Mac and PC's.","id":"1828"}
{"text":"This laptop leaves alot to be desired, I have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice...","id":"426"}
{"text":"I have found it very easy to use, very imformative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.","id":"2901"}
{"text":"I don't have stupid pop up windows (even when I have pop ups blocked), I don't have to wait 5 minutes for a webpage to download, and best of all I can run all the web programming software I need to use all at once without slowing me down.","id":"2645"}
{"text":"I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room;","id":"3070"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money or time.","id":"738"}
{"text":"It has spent more time in repair shops than i can possibly recount here.","id":"729"}
{"text":"Memory is upgradable.","id":"2813"}
{"text":"Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.","id":"2063"}
{"text":"Well, I bought this laptop a month or two ago.","id":"651"}
{"text":"My MacBook Pro has been a huge disappointment.","id":"352"}
{"text":"Received all four in good order;","id":"1751"}
{"text":"The computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it.","id":"2048"}
{"text":"this is starting off good.","id":"3009"}
{"text":"The large screen also helps when you are working in design based programs like Adobe Creative Suite.","id":"2154"}
{"text":"The only pro to this computer is it was under $600!","id":"1428"}
{"text":"Moral of the story:-Do not buy anything from companies that do not respect their customers.","id":"648"}
{"text":"This is my first Dell I heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it!","id":"779"}
{"text":"As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.","id":"1022"}
{"text":"Very small and portable I've had this netbook about 12 hrs now and It's better than expected.","id":"2217"}
{"text":"She said Wal Mart rants and raves abouy carring Dell because it's a big name but they are a piece of garbage.","id":"1277"}
{"text":"NOT WITH APPLE.","id":"1825"}
{"text":"After 3 pleasant weeks of use, the laptop just died.","id":"876"}
{"text":"Each time taking about 1 day or so.","id":"1009"}
{"text":"Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.","id":"1079"}
{"text":"If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.","id":"227"}
{"text":"So a couple of years later, I was a dumb college girl and had to have the wireless internet.","id":"2640"}
{"text":"This netbook went bad on me after 3 days.","id":"749"}
{"text":"Probably won't work either.","id":"2732"}
{"text":"Great product by Apple with the new great looking design.","id":"2655"}
{"text":"I love the keyboard.","id":"2466"}
{"text":"Probably as good as you can get in a netbook, does everything I ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses.","id":"2382"}
{"text":"Overall I am very satisfied with the purchase.","id":"3084"}
{"text":"In my line of work, I often have to take work home, and this makes it so easy.","id":"580"}
{"text":"\u00a0 They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.","id":"855"}
{"text":"I use iphoto all the time, which is a great program for anyone who is into photography - amateurs and experts alike.","id":"2213"}
{"text":"I bought this laptop for my son in 2007 for his Christmas present.","id":"2013"}
{"text":"It took so much time.","id":"2412"}
{"text":"I hate it.","id":"2025"}
{"text":"The screen isn't huge, but that doesn't matter when I output media to the 50 inch LCD TV.","id":"2673"}
{"text":"I'll stick to Tashiba.","id":"874"}
{"text":"I will have to purchase Spy ware or Nortell for privacy protection.","id":"2773"}
{"text":"You will not regret buying such a great thing like this!","id":"1589"}
{"text":"I was said it's videocard.","id":"1107"}
{"text":"Plus stylish.","id":"2493"}
{"text":"For the price and what I get out of it has exceeded my expectations.","id":"2870"}
{"text":"And, if you are going to deal with HP be careful.","id":"182"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I took the computer into Best Buy where I purchased it and they kept it over night to study it.","id":"1903"}
{"text":"If your time is worth anything to you, if you are tired of rebooting, reformatting, reinstalling, trying to find drivers, if you want a computer to work for you for a change, make the change to this computer.","id":"244"}
{"text":"My MacBook Pro is no exception.","id":"307"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Unless you don't care how long it takes to get going, find something else.","id":"1871"}
{"text":"(You may be reading one now!","id":"1183"}
{"text":"The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard.","id":"2132"}
{"text":"I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!","id":"69"}
{"text":"In fact, he said, about 10% of their products fail.","id":"1360"}
{"text":"This is the first Apple product that I have purchased.","id":"2059"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Now, as easy as it is to use, and I do think it is a great STARTER laptop.","id":"938"}
{"text":"This causes my wrist to scrape up against it.","id":"1692"}
{"text":"Enough said.","id":"1114"}
{"text":"Setting would change for some reason, the screen size would change on it's own, like the pixel sizes and whatnot.","id":"496"}
{"text":"It had some kind of pre installed software update that completely shut the computer down when you clicked it.","id":"2015"}
{"text":"Ever since I bought this laptop, so far I've experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services I received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines.","id":"1138"}
{"text":"I do not plan on going back.","id":"1695"}
{"text":"No laptop is perfect, but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you.","id":"3068"}
{"text":"I really like the Mac 15.4in. Notebook, but its very pricey.","id":"372"}
{"text":"Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.","id":"41"}
{"text":"iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos.","id":"2250"}
{"text":"Other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more.","id":"2654"}
{"text":"We were occasional Mac users before, but most recently owned a budget PC since it is what we could afford.","id":"2473"}
{"text":"Called tech support and got the usual Acer \"We don't support software but for $$$ we can help you\" I explained there was no software involved in booting.","id":"745"}
{"text":"I would never tell anyone to buy one either.","id":"2024"}
{"text":"The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.","id":"1531"}
{"text":"The only thing I didn't learn in my research was the software I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection, in case it gets broken, or crashes etc.","id":"2768"}

{"text":"I thought the price was great for the specs.","id":"144"}
{"text":"I was tired of going without my laptop every few weeks.","id":"1938"}
{"text":"the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.","id":"2305"}
{"text":"So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.","id":"3044"}
{"text":"Just for a stupid CD.","id":"2115"}
{"text":"Keys stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet.","id":"2709"}
{"text":"It crashes, and when it goes flat, it just DIES (like a PC, maybe worse) and I loose all my open documents!","id":"51"}
{"text":"I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.","id":"310"}
{"text":"Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point.","id":"19"}
{"text":"I am now making a point to avoid their products and I hope my experience can serve as a warning to you as well.","id":"122"}
{"text":"I'v spent as much for shipping as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand.","id":"408"}
{"text":"I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers.","id":"2426"}
{"text":"This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!","id":"984"}
{"text":"When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP, yes they do seem to offer less for a higher cost.","id":"2117"}
{"text":"\" Then I proceed to tell her that I checked out other retail stores that carry the netbook and it wasn't LIKE THAT.","id":"1294"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me.","id":"1853"}
{"text":"The only downfall is the volume control.","id":"2994"}
{"text":"Clearly, there is something wrong with the product and LG didn't take up the responsibility.","id":"1324"}
{"text":"Very fast boot up and shut down.","id":"246"}
{"text":"Right out of the box, this little netbook did everything I asked of it, including streaming the everyday video you're bound to encounter checking mail and websites (my biggest complaint previously).","id":"1539"}
{"text":"I am very happy with this laptop.","id":"2869"}
{"text":"this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with.","id":"2536"}
{"text":"I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what I need it.","id":"2765"}
{"text":"What a mistake!","id":"1266"}
{"text":"If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more, or buy a USB wireless card.","id":"1885"}
{"text":"I had read online that some users were having sound problems.","id":"1952"}
{"text":"My last computer, a Toshiba, cost only $400, and worked like a charm for many years.","id":"1440"}
{"text":"It discharges too quickly.","id":"2949"}
{"text":"But to be honest, the compatibility issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time.","id":"1206"}
{"text":"\u00a0 three years is a decent life, but this must make it to graduation and beyond.","id":"1461"}
{"text":"I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college.","id":"705"}
{"text":"TOSHIBA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM.","id":"1445"}
{"text":"Then it ceased charging at all.","id":"109"}
{"text":"An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.","id":"1122"}
{"text":"I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it, however I would highly suggest purchasing a stand however, due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink.","id":"1599"}
{"text":"*=Webcam is a bit laggy, not the greatest.","id":"1050"}

{"text":"Stay away from HP.","id":"759"}
{"text":"The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me, they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me.","id":"1942"}
{"text":"I've haven't had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off.","id":"2978"}
{"text":"Wonderful sleek case design is only on the outside.","id":"2288"}
{"text":"It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.","id":"2702"}
{"text":"I like it!","id":"215"}
{"text":"The pricing is very competitive.","id":"3036"}
{"text":"so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him.","id":"2367"}
{"text":"Connecting to my wireless router via built-in wireless took no time at all.","id":"209"}
{"text":"Its still going.","id":"1586"}
{"text":"This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.","id":"2157"}
{"text":"There is NO way I will buy a LG product in the future.","id":"1337"}
{"text":"I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.","id":"301"}
{"text":"Prior to this computer, I owned a PowerBook G4 for 6 years (quite a long time for a laptop).","id":"305"}
{"text":"Maybe this is virus related, maybe not, but the computer has locked up many times, and on two occasions, the screen has simply gone black.","id":"1190"}
{"text":"The advantages of owning 'a 'mac are numerous.","id":"2178"}
{"text":"I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.","id":"3025"}
{"text":"Using this machine is like a mild form of torture.","id":"37"}
{"text":"This wiped out several programs that were installed on the computer when it was bought.","id":"2021"}
{"text":"On the twelfth day that I had the notebook, I decided to go to Dell's website and update it.","id":"996"}
{"text":"The computer blinks it shuts off at will.","id":"791"}
{"text":"Excellent product for the money.","id":"2906"}
{"text":"It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.","id":"333"}
{"text":"I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall\u00a0 some programs.","id":"1436"}
{"text":"The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.","id":"2359"}
{"text":"I can do everything I could before, only faster and more efficiently.","id":"1637"}
{"text":"I called Toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem.","id":"2981"}
{"text":"the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too.","id":"2839"}
{"text":"\u00a0 i dont understand why i spent twice as much to get a laptop rather than a desktop when my lap top is completely\u00a0immoble.","id":"1456"}
{"text":"For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any;","id":"3077"}
{"text":"Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.","id":"2042"}
{"text":"Despite the plethora of problems, I managed to use technological trickery to keep the machine operational for two years.","id":"1988"}
{"text":"I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.","id":"237"}
{"text":"Simply amazing computer!!","id":"380"}
{"text":"I first purchased this Dell model \"1764\" on April 6, 201","id":"994"}
{"text":"The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance.","id":"219"}
{"text":"Two times with in one month.","id":"1024"}
{"text":"The only downfall is a lot of the software I have won't work with Mac and iWork is not worth the price of it.","id":"2532"}
{"text":"Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.","id":"669"}
{"text":"For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).","id":"422"}
{"text":"Whenever tried to turn it on, it would restart as soon as the BIOS launched Windows (or Winblows, as I like ot call it).","id":"1993"}
{"text":"BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.","id":"2497"}
{"text":"The mousepad is a huge pain in the arse!","id":"888"}
{"text":"I hope to edit this in the next few hours, I am going to try to install my own copy of Windows 7.","id":"1120"}
{"text":"If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.","id":"770"}
{"text":") I also purchased  Applecare  for $300, which is a three year extended warranty, since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two.","id":"1174"}
{"text":"I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use.","id":"2072"}
{"text":"I run windows via bootcamp for the couple programs I do not want to buy a mac version of, like my cad programs.","id":"2100"}
{"text":"C'mon, LG.","id":"1331"}
{"text":"Whenever I call Dell about an unrelated problem, they ask me if my laptop is running slowly and if I'd like to purchase more memory for $75.","id":"60"}
{"text":"\u00a0 since then\u00a0i have had minor problems with slow operation.","id":"1454"}
{"text":"If you faintly come close to touching this thing while typing, all craziness may break loose.","id":"889"}
{"text":"Registration\/1st use is easy.","id":"2705"}
{"text":"I love this laptop, and use it everyday to do something, and never lets me down.","id":"1498"}
{"text":"Finally was able to reach a young lady in California and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date.","id":"393"}
{"text":"I definitely will buy a Mac again if and when this computer ever fails.","id":"2215"}
{"text":"The Toshiba Mini Notebook, Model NB 305-N410BL, is a great little computer.","id":"718"}
{"text":"Take your time and go through the tutorials patiently.","id":"1177"}
{"text":"So if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name TOSHIBA on it...","id":"438"}
{"text":"(I'm an excellent touch typist, and my hands are very sensitive, too.","id":"2330"}
{"text":"\u00a0 This time the mouse pad and right click key wouldn't work!","id":"961"}
{"text":"\u00a0 EVENTUALLY we pushed hard enough to convince them that this was the MACHINE that was causing the problems.","id":"1914"}
{"text":"The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.","id":"3026"}
{"text":"I bought a cordless mouse for it, but don't always take it out;","id":"2336"}
{"text":"When I got it, I immediately noticed that it was quite heavy and thick and not really attractive.","id":"1605"}
{"text":"It is sleek, smooth, and lightweight.","id":"384"}
{"text":"i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well, but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing.","id":"2539"}
{"text":"It took Toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem.","id":"2853"}
{"text":"They only stay charged a little over an hour.","id":"2976"}
{"text":"Now they are believers in the product.","id":"1782"}
{"text":"Had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it.","id":"53"}
{"text":"Hewlett Packard HP Pavillion DV6000 Laptop is the worst laptop we have ever bought.","id":"2012"}
{"text":"I had never owned a Mac before;","id":"1148"}
{"text":"The 4 USB ports are nice, but the two on the side only work now and then.","id":"1127"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.","id":"1843"}
{"text":"i try to use it today and I can't logon.","id":"410"}
{"text":"Keyboard could use some trimming.","id":"1128"}
{"text":"The bottom-line is that this laptop just isn't worth it.","id":"849"}
{"text":"I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months.","id":"173"}
{"text":"Its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes.","id":"1767"}
{"text":"Returned laptop for repair a 2nd time and it came back with obvious physical damage (keyboard bulging and speaker grill pressed in), buttons not working and USB ports inoperative.","id":"1887"}
{"text":"When I am next to my router on my HP I get full service, on my Eee PC I get 3 bars.","id":"1880"}
{"text":"I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.","id":"101"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed about this product.","id":"1033"}
{"text":"The letter A stopped working after the first week.","id":"792"}
{"text":"By the time I was finally able to get a work order to get it fixed I had been without my computer for almost a week while I was an Online College Student, so it was very inconvenient and I had to send it off and be without it while it was being fixed also.","id":"1927"}
{"text":"It out performs any other laptop on the market today.","id":"2278"}
{"text":"This is what I call a good after sales service.","id":"1330"}
{"text":"Maybe it's Acer, maybe it's MSFT.","id":"1117"}
{"text":"So if you want a good machine that does almost anything this is the one, if you want a low budget computer then look at the other great brands Best Buy sells.","id":"2103"}
{"text":"I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.","id":"3079"}
{"text":"I would buy one of these for every person in my office if I could.","id":"579"}
{"text":"With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.","id":"973"}
{"text":"HAVING HAD EXPERIENCE WITH A TOSHIBA LAPTOP, I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE TOSHIBA NB305 LAPTOP HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS.","id":"1083"}
{"text":"Tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk.","id":"2727"}
{"text":"Most everything is fine with this machine: speed, capacity, build.","id":"2791"}
{"text":"I have never had it crash, randomly turn off,","id":"1499"}
{"text":"For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res.","id":"161"}
{"text":"I made a photo book as a gift, on my computer, pushed \"Buy\" and it drew from my iTunes account and sent the book to my house, the book was of perfect quality-exactly how I had created it and looked better than I had even imagined.","id":"1494"}
{"text":"I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!).","id":"1545"}
{"text":"It is in the best condition and has a really high quality.","id":"1587"}
{"text":"When it come time for warranty service to Toshiba you don't matter.","id":"1236"}
{"text":"\u00a0 However the frozen screens kept happening.","id":"1911"}
{"text":"Ive owned Apple computers and laptops for as long as i could remember.","id":"3052"}
{"text":"At least those computers didn't just die on me like this one.","id":"1161"}
{"text":"It's A MAC!!","id":"556"}
{"text":"\u00a0 i had the bulk of problems with\u00a0my lap top\u00a0within the first six months.","id":"1452"}
{"text":"This is my first LG product.","id":"1334"}
{"text":"It is short on space, and downloads always had problems being completed, or were said to be 'corrupted'.","id":"275"}
{"text":"3) Horrible customer support","id":"191"}
{"text":"The LED backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more.","id":"2349"}
{"text":"very very slow laptop.","id":"606"}
{"text":"I'm going back to DELL.","id":"1032"}
{"text":"With what I paid for this computer it should have had everything on it.","id":"1974"}
{"text":"Apple is always great about the aesthetics of things, they always come up with good looking products.","id":"2611"}
{"text":"I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke.","id":"283"}
{"text":"Runs smooth and quick.","id":"2940"}
{"text":"Not a bad laptop, it's a bit slow, but gets the job done.","id":"1840"}
{"text":"Honestly, I spent more time waiting for it to unfreeze then actually doing what I got on there for!","id":"1249"}
{"text":"This a starter notebook.","id":"2915"}
{"text":"No I am generous calling it slow.","id":"860"}
{"text":"The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.","id":"2577"}
{"text":"The graphics are great.","id":"2933"}
{"text":"All-in-all, I would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone.","id":"457"}
{"text":"in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.","id":"1208"}
{"text":"The big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies , pictures and etc!","id":"2494"}
{"text":"the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones\/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.","id":"2807"}
{"text":"For the [$] price (special offer) this is a great laptop.","id":"12"}
{"text":"I have had at least eight Toshiba laptops, and they have been outstanding, including this one.","id":"2109"}
{"text":"I called back to ensure that received it, they had.","id":"765"}
{"text":"the manufacturer's warranty only covers replacement\/repair of parts.","id":"986"}
{"text":"What I'd like is for the laptop to run well without having to purchase additional memory.","id":"61"}
{"text":"If you can afford a new laptop, and are in the market for one, of course, then definitely go for this.","id":"1790"}
{"text":"Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.","id":"807"}
{"text":"It works exactly like it did the day I took it out of the box.","id":"2463"}
{"text":"Now, the next issue I had freaked me out.","id":"947"}
{"text":"i love ths notebook.","id":"1477"}
{"text":"It is fast booting up , shutting down, and connection with the internet.","id":"2487"}
{"text":"The battery life is great.","id":"1638"}
{"text":"This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine;","id":"3082"}
{"text":"Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's \"like new,\" I might have 8 months next time.","id":"1157"}
{"text":"I got this laptop on Black Friday.","id":"1251"}
{"text":"\u00a0 They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.","id":"1909"}
{"text":"I fell in love with it.","id":"3014"}
{"text":"It was just one problem after another for me, and that's reason we had forked out so much money was so we wouldn't have anything to worry about.","id":"518"}
{"text":"There is nothing to complain about the system.","id":"2512"}
{"text":"and it comes with the new OSX that comes with new features that makes the use more easy.","id":"2234"}
{"text":"Maybe not the cutting edge (Satellite L455D) but it is a workhorse.","id":"3002"}
{"text":"But the Macbook is the best!","id":"318"}
{"text":"Now the screen is going darker, darker, darker.","id":"405"}
{"text":"EITHER THE COMPUTER IS TOO SLOW TO DETECT THE KEYS TYPED (THIS IS UNLIKELY AS I AM A SLOW TYPIST) OR THE KEYBOARD SIMPLY DOES NOT DETECT THE KEYS BEING TYPED.","id":"1086"}
{"text":"I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it.","id":"1500"}
{"text":"As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....","id":"604"}
{"text":"My wife also has problems with her Asus - different model.","id":"893"}
{"text":"Features such as the Dashboard (allows you to view frequently used tools like a calculator, weather forecast, movie times, calendar, computer post its etc.","id":"2504"}
{"text":"This computer is the ideal college companion.","id":"2104"}
{"text":"Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them.","id":"2206"}
{"text":"The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.","id":"74"}
{"text":"when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.","id":"793"}
{"text":"BOUGHT FROM WAL-MART, I BELIEVE THAT THIS LAPTOP WAS A REPAIRED ITEM.","id":"2662"}
{"text":"Couldnt not use it.","id":"2726"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I sent it back and found this time that the battery was faulty, so I got a new one and some other fixes they found.","id":"956"}
{"text":"I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.","id":"2044"}
{"text":"Great pick for portability and affordability.","id":"2516"}
{"text":"It's fast, it's easy easy easy to set up, easy to hook to my wireless network.","id":"2760"}
{"text":"I previously purchased a 13\" macbook (had pro specs and was aluminum style) which had a nvidia 9800 (If I am not mistaken) and it had major heating issues.","id":"1597"}
{"text":"They didn't even try to assist me or even offer a replacement.","id":"126"}
{"text":"We used PC products - it seemed simpler to continue with the same thing.","id":"2404"}
{"text":"The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.","id":"1329"}
{"text":"I love my Samsung TV and Galaxy S smartphone, but this Netbook was a very poor computer.","id":"1223"}
{"text":"I made a perfect decision when I bought the Toshiba!","id":"3005"}
{"text":"I take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.","id":"2338"}
{"text":"The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1\/2 an hour.","id":"2948"}
{"text":"It still heats up like mad and I am unable to use it with the computer directly on my lap for more than five to ten minutes at a time.","id":"117"}
{"text":"The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.","id":"2027"}
{"text":"I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one.","id":"2877"}
{"text":"\u00a0 They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.","id":"853"}
{"text":"I would Highly recommend this MacBook.","id":"1833"}
{"text":"About 2 months ago i bought the 2011 macbook pro, which was an upgrade from my 2010 macbook pro.","id":"3053"}
{"text":"Let's just get this out of the way, I love Apple!","id":"316"}
{"text":"Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.","id":"2936"}
{"text":"The keyboard has a wonderful nature feel.","id":"684"}
{"text":"They went through asking me open up various components, taking battery out, hard disk apart, and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it.","id":"464"}
{"text":"*4 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Annoyed at MacHouse Amsterdam, decided to send complaint email to Apple.","id":"628"}
{"text":"While there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down, this occurs far less frequently than on PC computers and laptops that I've used.","id":"596"}
{"text":"Bought with a credit card.","id":"342"}
{"text":"The battery doesn't last long but I'm sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem.","id":"2762"}
{"text":"I was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing, I took it for granted that these features were standard.","id":"2440"}
{"text":"I did a lot of research and ended up thinking this Toshiba was the best one for me.","id":"1951"}
{"text":"\"  I've had it now about 2 months and absolutely LOVE IT.","id":"2334"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.","id":"1046"}
{"text":"I bought this last week, and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch-mouse stopped responding.","id":"735"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have purchased this computer.","id":"2176"}
{"text":"Oh yea, has no numeric pad on the side.","id":"2821"}
{"text":"The cover for the DVD drive soon came off, too--a mark of poor construction quality.","id":"1987"}
{"text":"I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.","id":"1386"}
{"text":"really no problems with the hand me down computers I received from my children.","id":"1354"}
{"text":"I did not take the class and wish that I would have.","id":"1830"}
{"text":"It would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required.","id":"2428"}
{"text":"But the arm velcro is torn after one use.","id":"1327"}
{"text":"Not good for a person who gets online daily.","id":"54"}
{"text":"The laptop was returned but audio issue was not fixed.","id":"1886"}
{"text":"I can't even remember how I finally got it taken care of, but I was done with Sony after that!","id":"517"}
{"text":"So it was only about 2 weeks ago.","id":"1282"}
{"text":"I just love this lap top, I just wish it were all silver or they had all black.","id":"2888"}
{"text":"The software is amazing.","id":"1639"}
{"text":"We carry the netbook around here and there, hence it's kinda of irritating when the LCD just \"slide\" downwards.","id":"1288"}
{"text":"There is nothing better.","id":"2607"}
{"text":"I now own another Hewlitt Packard.","id":"1273"}
{"text":"The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown.","id":"2959"}
{"text":"The battery life is amazing, the versitility is outstanding.","id":"26"}
{"text":"It is known as Safari, and if you are doing any website work, you should know that many hosting companies do not support it.","id":"1194"}
{"text":"Vista is a nightmare.","id":"264"}
{"text":"i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.","id":"798"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I have used a couple of others on the job as well.","id":"1862"}
{"text":"The program came with the computer and works beautifully.","id":"2214"}
{"text":"Posted Nov 8, 2010 - Two weeks ago I bought this notebook.","id":"1102"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Acer won't replace the laptop.","id":"985"}
{"text":"I am also upset with CR for giving a good rating.","id":"752"}

{"text":"I don't really have a complaint.","id":"2394"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure it's not newegg's fault but when you turn on a computer you just bought you want it to at least get to desktop.","id":"1116"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Best Buy ended up junking the computer and giving me a replacement computer.","id":"1915"}

{"text":"If I have a problem with any of my apple items I make an appointment at one of my local stores and they work on correcting it right there.","id":"1826"}
{"text":"So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.","id":"2071"}
{"text":"I claim that this has no value to me, the laptop was new anyway.","id":"644"}
{"text":"Enough said.","id":"1125"}
{"text":"Not working = bad","id":"186"}

{"text":"I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.","id":"40"}
{"text":"The unibody design is edgy and durable.","id":"2348"}
{"text":"STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.","id":"1441"}
{"text":"But, for the cost this is a winner.","id":"2860"}
{"text":"Let me tell you, this machine is great.","id":"2630"}
{"text":"I have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is AWSOME!","id":"2842"}

{"text":"\u00a0 The second issue I had with it occured a month later and it kept overheating, even if on for less than an hour!","id":"944"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Also, the battery does not last very long at all.","id":"817"}
{"text":"Good luck with your purchase options.","id":"2683"}
{"text":"Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac.","id":"45"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!","id":"1108"}
{"text":"They are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site.","id":"465"}
{"text":"I bought it from HSN because it was \"bundled\" with extra software, but as it turns out, that software just crashes it more often.....","id":"427"}
{"text":"I looked around and based off my price\/features comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here.","id":"3085"}

{"text":"More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.","id":"1434"}
{"text":"No viruses.","id":"1526"}
{"text":"It is everything that I would want in a computer.","id":"2525"}

{"text":"\u00a0 They removed them and returned the computer to me.","id":"1905"}
{"text":"I don't understand why only Windows 7 Starter is included.","id":"2386"}
{"text":"On 3 July 2004, I purcased this model at Best Buy for about $150","id":"1981"}
{"text":"I went with him and we picked this one.","id":"2881"}
{"text":"While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.","id":"18"}
{"text":"This is my second MACBOOK PRO and it's better than ever.","id":"1621"}
{"text":"My macbook is so much better looking and so thin!","id":"1610"}
{"text":"The notebook would not turn back on again.","id":"998"}
{"text":"The ease of use is wonderful.","id":"2292"}
{"text":"This system came loaded with Windows 7 Starter.","id":"2596"}
{"text":"-When battery life went to 4 hours or less, took it to the MacHouse Amsterdam for repair (26th of August).","id":"614"}
{"text":"The battery gets so HOT it is scary.","id":"171"}
{"text":"Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.","id":"2753"}
{"text":"It's so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with.","id":"3"}
{"text":"The apple macbook pro nothing to say butprofessionally great and outstanding.","id":"1644"}
{"text":"It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.","id":"332"}
{"text":"I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use.","id":"1641"}
{"text":"Mom, Dad, Brother, sister, You name it!","id":"1680"}
{"text":"but it came back in even worse shape.","id":"1164"}
{"text":"The only thing I would change about it is the mouse keys.","id":"2814"}
{"text":"It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.","id":"43"}
{"text":"Before, I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate and used only the downloaded drivers from Acer's site.","id":"1056"}
{"text":"I have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute.","id":"2996"}
{"text":"It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.","id":"3022"}
{"text":"After that I turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid.","id":"1850"}
{"text":"So far, a great product.","id":"2184"}
{"text":"He loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started.","id":"2368"}
{"text":"u can do what u want in just few seconds, even to start up your computer takes few seconds.","id":"2233"}
{"text":"It's the most wonderful thing in the entire world.","id":"1465"}
{"text":"So I'd pop them off to see what the problem was, well guess what? The darn thing wouldn't go back on.","id":"1468"}
{"text":"Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!","id":"1613"}
{"text":"They sent out a Sony 'Certified' technician.","id":"510"}
{"text":"They have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and I'm looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular.","id":"2353"}
{"text":"Getting the Apple Care plan is a must.","id":"2563"}
{"text":"I've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro.","id":"2264"}
{"text":"overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive.","id":"2306"}
{"text":"-Apple offers to send replacement and after 10 days I send them the old computer.","id":"635"}

{"text":"Our Apple 13.3 MacBook Pro Notebook Computer (Z0J80001) Notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking.","id":"2608"}
{"text":"I am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.","id":"1432"}
{"text":"The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.","id":"102"}
{"text":"The only downfall is the battery only last 1.5-2.0 hrs when not plugged in.","id":"2966"}
{"text":"The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.","id":"2211"}
{"text":"Aside from the trial software and the short battery life, lack of a webcam, its great.","id":"2819"}
{"text":"As a die-hard Windows enthusiast, I shunned the idea of a Mac until this point.","id":"1633"}
{"text":"I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.","id":"1351"}
{"text":"if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again.","id":"2544"}
{"text":"I had a MacBook Notebook, and it had absolutely no protection from viruses, spyware, malware, etc.","id":"272"}
{"text":"The computer loads in about a 1\/10th of the time that my PC did, and I have all of the programs that were on my PC.","id":"2220"}
{"text":"I made the right decision.","id":"2165"}
{"text":"In the past few years, I've had terrible experiences with HP.","id":"93"}
{"text":"Overall, it's ok.","id":"2691"}
{"text":"Graphics are clean and sharp, internet interfaces are seamless.","id":"2723"}
{"text":"The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!","id":"73"}
{"text":"Sony parts reliability and quality of service is recenlty the worst.","id":"1082"}
{"text":"I am very Happy!","id":"1520"}
{"text":"As with any laptop not purchased with software options, it comes with a lot of what I consider useless applications.","id":"2677"}
{"text":"Its Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.","id":"2588"}
{"text":"I occassionaly use it for work via VPN and it has not given me any problems.","id":"3061"}
{"text":"I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.","id":"2036"}
{"text":"It just works flawlessly!","id":"223"}
{"text":"Do you think I purposely \"destroy\" my netbook, so that I can demand a new set? Do you think it's fun to take public transport all the way to the service center and get a non-satisfactory solution? Or rather NO solution.","id":"1332"}
{"text":"I'm having the laptop returned unrepaired since paying $176 every 3  months just isn't worth it (that's about how long the port seems to  last).","id":"846"}
{"text":"Ok first.","id":"2127"}
{"text":"So if you move laptop a lot, it might get loose, however it sits pretty tightly.","id":"1081"}
{"text":"another satisfied customer.","id":"3067"}
{"text":"\u00a0 also the battery is completely shot.","id":"1455"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!","id":"716"}
{"text":"\/ awesome cooling system\/ much better grafics card (ATI 5870) \/ 8GB RAM\/ LED backlit screen...","id":"162"}
{"text":"The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.","id":"969"}
{"text":"But after using it a couple of weeks, the overall operation is poor.","id":"145"}
{"text":"Will not buy another Toshiba, this is my second, not happy w\/ either.","id":"2721"}
{"text":"Compared to similarly spec'd PCs, this machine is good value, well built and works easily right out of the box.","id":"2187"}
{"text":"The cool thing about the Mac Book was that I went on my honeymoon and shot a bunch of pictures and movies with my iPhone, then I came back and put them onto my Macbook and made a pretty good DVD movie with all the pictures and videos from my trip.","id":"1709"}
{"text":"for two months, when YOU GUESSED IT.","id":"959"}
{"text":"This was my first MacBook purchase ever.","id":"1820"}
{"text":"Screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive.","id":"2812"}
{"text":"I will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day.","id":"2899"}
{"text":"Quite simply this is the best laptop I have ever owned.","id":"228"}
{"text":"Or the cursor would show up some place else.","id":"1028"}
{"text":"The newer MacBook that I have purchased is one of the best computers.","id":"1762"}
{"text":"I have had some excellent computer and have found I had no idea what to do with them","id":"586"}
{"text":"As it turns out, I just didn't know any better.","id":"1556"}
{"text":"I've had friends with Acers who seem to have had similar or exact same problems.","id":"1474"}
{"text":"What can I say.","id":"1103"}
{"text":"It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops.","id":"87"}
{"text":"What's also interesting is this survey changed my ratings the first time I submitted it in case it doesn't keep what I put here are my aratings","id":"551"}
{"text":"it might be something deep within Windows, for I was unable to create a disk image on my hard drive.","id":"1997"}
{"text":"I had a toshiba for 10 years.","id":"873"}
{"text":"The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!","id":"2548"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Now I had not tried to use this since the disc drive had been replaced and after taking it back to the Geek Squad I found out they had accidently not used the right drive when they replaced the first one, so back it went to get the correct drive.","id":"953"}
{"text":"First, you ll discover that the word processing program known as  Appleworks  rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.","id":"1179"}
{"text":"she can't tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system.","id":"2399"}
{"text":"With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down.","id":"1431"}
{"text":"It doesn't bother me though.","id":"1672"}
{"text":"I've had this laptop for about a month now.","id":"2957"}
{"text":"I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that's standard size.","id":"1876"}
{"text":"It was okay for over a week before the blue screens started occuring again.","id":"660"}
{"text":"\u00a0 English must have been his third or fourth language.","id":"1847"}
{"text":"Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.","id":"2992"}
{"text":"I am just ONE of the million customers.","id":"1341"}
{"text":"it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again.","id":"2835"}
{"text":"apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.","id":"559"}
{"text":"Returned laptop for a 3rd repair and it came back with previous problems fixed (except for speaker grill) but the unit started locking up during use and eventually would not operate at all.","id":"1888"}
{"text":"I just plug this into my 22\" Monitor and the speedy MacOSX performs just as well on this dual-core that my Dell did with Windows 7 with a quad-core.","id":"1738"}
{"text":"Love the graphics, awesome programs (including Garageband), and really cool default background.","id":"374"}
{"text":"Screen, keyboard, and mouse: If you cant see yourself spending the extra money to jump up to a Mac the beautiful screen, responsive island backlit keyboard, and fun multi-touch mouse is worth the extra money to me alone.","id":"1746"}
{"text":"I am taking back today.","id":"737"}
{"text":"My parents bought it for me as a graduation gift, and i'm totally (almost kind of maybe definitely) obsessed with it.","id":"450"}
{"text":"The MacBook is way too overpriced for something so simple and chaotic.","id":"279"}
{"text":"-Complied to their protocol, called number, made \"case\", got an email address to send complaint.","id":"631"}
{"text":"The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it!","id":"79"}
{"text":"It quit working within a weeks time.","id":"974"}
{"text":"but after i got used to it i love it.","id":"2302"}
{"text":"I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office).","id":"313"}
{"text":"\u00a0 After 4 days, being denied 6 times and told off once, I managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt.","id":"1851"}
{"text":"Overall, I experienced a huge change in that my mac runs pretty fast compared to my old PC.","id":"1694"}
{"text":"When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.","id":"174"}
{"text":"It also came with a built it web cam which is great because I can see an communicate with my family members back home.","id":"2452"}
{"text":"Good monitor and performed well.","id":"2751"}
{"text":"They are closed at 9pm eastern.","id":"1203"}
{"text":"In those three years, I've had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by Apple quickly and easily.","id":"591"}
{"text":"Although my model was listed as recalled, HP denied my claim.","id":"397"}
{"text":"It was secure and easy to navigate.","id":"2524"}
{"text":"I was a little weary at purchasing another 13\" macbook almost 2 years later but t looks like the newer macbooks have gotten its current line of graphics cards in order this time around.","id":"1598"}
{"text":"The machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your HDTV.","id":"267"}
{"text":"I am loyal to Apple.","id":"1515"}
{"text":"They are by far the easiest systems to actually learn about computers with.","id":"2182"}
{"text":"I will be patient for few months.","id":"3051"}
{"text":"this apple navigates you thru the unexplored world of the internet.","id":"561"}
{"text":"This was purchased for my daughter and I was pleasantly surprised.","id":"2591"}
{"text":"Finally set the unit back to HP after a month of hell.","id":"757"}
{"text":"I couldn't afford a new mac, so I bought a PC instead.","id":"2641"}
{"text":"The video card is great for media, and above average for gaming, but not a gamers first choice.","id":"154"}
{"text":"It was always getting froze up.","id":"1267"}
{"text":"my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!","id":"1153"}
{"text":"But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!","id":"766"}
{"text":"I got the blue screen of death the first month I got it.","id":"188"}
{"text":"This is the third MacBook Pro in our family.","id":"1779"}
{"text":"Apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience!","id":"2551"}
{"text":"I had of course bought a 3 year warranty, so I sent it in to be replaced and (almost 2 months later) the dv4 is what the sent me as a replacement.","id":"100"}
{"text":"Apparently there is a manufacturing defect, something with the amount of thermal paste.","id":"1444"}
{"text":"Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.","id":"1796"}
{"text":"Took several hours with customer support before I could even start the PC out of the box.","id":"753"}
{"text":"Asus facial recognition doesn't work and windows logon isn't either.","id":"411"}
{"text":"Windows Vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service.","id":"988"}
{"text":"I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.","id":"1071"}
{"text":"Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.","id":"2830"}
{"text":"Can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display.","id":"2701"}
{"text":"Otherwise, all other features are a 1","id":"2968"}
{"text":"So in late March, early April 2009 I was without it again for a couple weeks while I had online courses I had to complete and my fiance was in Afghanistan and web conferencing was the best communication method we had.","id":"1931"}
{"text":"The performance is awesome.","id":"1723"}
{"text":"I pondered very long over this decision.","id":"1704"}
{"text":"This thing sucks!","id":"1091"}
{"text":"I Love my new computer!","id":"2942"}
{"text":"Okay, let's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy.","id":"702"}
{"text":"It was a Waste of money from day one!","id":"483"}
{"text":"I'm new - just switched from years of PC frustration.","id":"2198"}
{"text":"So I got another netbook which I love!","id":"1957"}
{"text":"But in fact it is totally the opposite.","id":"2118"}
{"text":"The display is beyond horrible.","id":"286"}
{"text":"He LEFT ME, instructions on what to do when this comes up, or that comes up......","id":"513"}
{"text":"It's a joke.","id":"3029"}
{"text":"There is hardly any memory on the computer's hard drive.","id":"1411"}
{"text":"Actually, I had noticed the one on the sales floor also didn't have sound!","id":"1956"}
{"text":"I started hainv problems with it within the first month.","id":"1918"}
{"text":"Next, most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.","id":"1469"}
{"text":"the laptop preformed pretty well.","id":"2833"}
{"text":"I'm honestly afraid that it will burn me, it's that hot!","id":"118"}
{"text":"But I don't see it as a problem.","id":"2325"}
{"text":"Numerous problems over the next 3 weeks until I got the blue screen of death and had to send the PC back to HP.","id":"754"}
{"text":"I think this will happen to any new version of computer\/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed.","id":"3050"}
{"text":"This one has had the same effect.","id":"3015"}
{"text":"And if you are a game player it works with World Of Warcraft wonderfully.","id":"2829"}
{"text":"This computer is absolutely AMAZING!!!","id":"674"}
{"text":"So buyer beware when buying Toshiba","id":"1217"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I found this laptop on sale for under 6000 at Best Buy which was a great deal!","id":"933"}
{"text":"I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.","id":"298"}
{"text":"I love the Apple products.","id":"442"}
{"text":"I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.","id":"1447"}
{"text":"The minute you fire it up it's all good, very easy user interface.","id":"1810"}
{"text":"I have had two Toshiba satellite computers and while they are okay, they are in no way comparable to the Mac.","id":"2191"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I actually contact Toshiba before I started having problem and was given run around after I supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired.","id":"1419"}
{"text":"They're absolutely useless, unless you count the joy of releasing anger while smashing into little peices against the wall.","id":"1250"}
{"text":"was a great deal i will give that.","id":"2832"}
{"text":"Theres also iDVD, a program dedicated to putting all your favorite media together- photos, recordings, video projects into one program so that you can create the perfect memoir for your parents, family, siblings, and any other person important in your life that there may be.","id":"1660"}
{"text":"\u00a0 His language was so bad I swore I was taking the turing test, and it was failing.","id":"1848"}
{"text":"After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.","id":"459"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba?\u00a0 Probably not ever again.","id":"1144"}
{"text":"I have used PC's and converting to this MacBook Pro was easy.","id":"2513"}
{"text":"I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.","id":"2884"}
{"text":"If what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.","id":"2082"}
{"text":"-Apparently, contactus@euro.apple.com is not a good address to send complaints.","id":"629"}
{"text":"It doesn't have a lot of frills, but I didn't need any, and being able to buy what I needed, and not more than I needed was very important.","id":"2847"}
{"text":"the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.","id":"1391"}
{"text":"I am sorry that I purchased this laptop.","id":"56"}
{"text":"Awesome graphics!","id":"2257"}
{"text":"It really is perfect for work and play.","id":"2617"}
{"text":"The pro is a great product, I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge (the edges hurt my wrists).","id":"2653"}
{"text":"I am a college student and it has been very useful.","id":"1763"}
{"text":"The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made.","id":"1760"}
{"text":"My sister is the electronics manager at Wal Mart and she says that HP is the best.","id":"1275"}
{"text":"One drawback I noticed was sound quality via USB.","id":"2674"}
{"text":"The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.","id":"519"}
{"text":"I needed a new computer for graduate school (had never owned a laptop before), and the only reason I didn't purchase a Mac was because my school's website strongly recommended students purchase PCs.","id":"57"}
{"text":"I have had another Mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.","id":"1534"}
{"text":"If you have the money I suggest going for the i7.","id":"2514"}
{"text":"That's very possible, but since they don't make Windows XP drivers for the sound card in this machine, I was stuck until Windows 7 came out.","id":"105"}

{"text":"I have been a PC user since middle school, but in my mid twenties I decided to convert to the dark side, or should I say the brighter side of life.","id":"1705"}

{"text":"without having to have extra equipment and\/or complicated routes to take to be able to do so.","id":"2903"}
{"text":"My first problem was with the pre-loaded Norton Firewall\/Security program.","id":"2851"}
{"text":"I had a USB connect but, i can't use it because it is not compatible.","id":"2741"}
{"text":"Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.","id":"398"}
{"text":"I ordered four D620 laptops.","id":"1750"}
{"text":"I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).","id":"329"}
{"text":"I saw this one, and I have the most difficult time trying to use them, they've made great dust collectors, I hate putting this computer down","id":"587"}
{"text":"I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.","id":"2069"}
{"text":"I love the multi-touch trackpad.","id":"2081"}
{"text":"I was psyched.","id":"2040"}
{"text":"I absolutely love my mac!","id":"553"}
{"text":"From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!","id":"2546"}
{"text":"HP is more interested in selling extended warranties (which cost more than the netbook new) then they are in helping or fixing.","id":"406"}
{"text":"It would not let me connect to my Wifi system where I lived.","id":"2852"}
{"text":"Not too much \"junk\" software to remove.","id":"14"}

{"text":"The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to, but overall it's worth it!","id":"1562"}
{"text":"It is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an Alienware gaming machine.","id":"2425"}
{"text":"The extended warranty for the $4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu.","id":"2786"}
{"text":"Only issue is that it is a little slow, and I'm fixing that by adding more RAM.","id":"2724"}
{"text":"It is easily portable and I take it everywhere I go and might require internet access.","id":"385"}
{"text":"If I have a few hundred dollars to spare, I'd buy the Pro line though, the 2.53 and 2.66 GHz model.","id":"2079"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.","id":"854"}
{"text":"But enough about that, I am an Apple convert for life.","id":"2116"}
{"text":"I love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the Laptop in the sky!!","id":"390"}
{"text":"But, Mac makes the switch from PC to Mac easy.","id":"2405"}
{"text":"Another issue I have with it is the battery.","id":"253"}
{"text":"HELP, HELP, OTHER THAN THAT GETS A GREAT LITTLE WONDER.","id":"1700"}
{"text":"Now I know!","id":"1278"}
{"text":"After 2 months of complaints, Asus finally sent the right power supply to my techies.","id":"881"}
{"text":"Even set at the highest level, the computer sacrifices its  queen every time.","id":"1188"}
{"text":"That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port.","id":"486"}
{"text":"My MacBook Pro works like a dream, it has never overheated, or even been slightly warm for that matter.","id":"1487"}
{"text":"PC users use the Powerpoint program for slide-show presentation and Mac users utilize Keynote.","id":"2508"}
{"text":"I can't begin to say how disappointed I am.","id":"864"}
{"text":"I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you're restricted to the width of your body for computing room.","id":"2571"}
{"text":"It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.","id":"1435"}
{"text":"Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.","id":"2748"}
{"text":"also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.","id":"350"}
{"text":"Take the simple, easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around.","id":"303"}
{"text":"It is as good as new.","id":"1306"}
{"text":"And it didn't show up on the reciept, I don't know how we ordered it online!","id":"489"}
{"text":"I went from BestBuy to Dell, Windows to Apple.","id":"2162"}
{"text":"Back then my entire family was Devoted to the Sony name.","id":"481"}
{"text":"When I got my laptop back after this first instance it worked okay for a little bit then I started expeirencing issues again, everything from programs and drivers failing again, to it powering off for no reason, to locking up and freezing and just all sorts of issues.","id":"1925"}
{"text":"Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.","id":"2749"}
{"text":"*3 weeks after giving the computer for repair*-Visited MacHouse Amsterdam.","id":"623"}
{"text":"They don't seem to be susceptible to viruses, which is one less big thing to worry about when it comes to computers.","id":"1167"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I was very excited because this was my first personal computer and I was purchasing it with my OWN money I had recieved from graduation presents.","id":"1897"}
{"text":"Asked the customer service rep.","id":"769"}
{"text":"So, I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.","id":"3046"}
{"text":"I cannot even imaging going back to a PC after using this wonderful computer.","id":"2190"}
{"text":"Basic computer.","id":"2685"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the hp pavillion and that was my replacement and now I could not imagine going back to an acer at all.","id":"1971"}
{"text":"It turns out that this hp pc had been preciously sold by Wal Mart.","id":"726"}
{"text":"I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.","id":"289"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me.","id":"1855"}
{"text":"I should have bought one a long time ago.","id":"2803"}
{"text":"I looked at the computer and it said updating but the asked for a product key.","id":"2017"}
{"text":"I got what I paid for.","id":"1133"}
{"text":"Just keep in mind the graphics is not dedicated so loading the movie almost took a minute, but it ran fairly smooth for a non-dedicated graphics card.","id":"1596"}

{"text":"\u00a0 However I dealt with this problem for over a year and it was more of a hastle then I have EVER had with anything.","id":"1916"}

{"text":"-4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.","id":"1047"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.","id":"762"}
{"text":"In fact, somehow (and I never opened it up) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently, behind the front of the screen, in the way of the display.","id":"113"}
{"text":"It seems to be incompatible with everything else.","id":"2533"}
{"text":"the mouse on the pad, the left button always sticks.","id":"2836"}
{"text":"\u00a0 When I took it back to Best Buy I asked them if they were seriously trying to drive me insane!","id":"962"}
{"text":"\u00a0 i have tried to charge on different batteries with no luck.","id":"1459"}
{"text":"I would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop, and the battery life is amazing.","id":"2188"}
{"text":"We use the built in tools often, iTunes is open nearly every day and works great with my iPhone.","id":"2274"}
{"text":"But my blog is read by my friends and search engine visitors.","id":"1343"}
{"text":"It was returned on the third day I owned it.","id":"1002"}
{"text":"IT WANT TAKE IT, IT KEEP SAYING ERROR.","id":"1699"}
{"text":"Anyone who is considering buying an Acer computer of any sort, I seriously suggest you look into buying a different brand.","id":"1941"}
{"text":"the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming.","id":"2303"}
{"text":"Highly recommend for daily use.","id":"2910"}
{"text":"We are addicted to the Mac.","id":"77"}
{"text":"Because it IS a defective product.","id":"1314"}
{"text":"Second, it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated","id":"2499"}
{"text":"True quality at a great price!","id":"2868"}
{"text":"Not easy to carry.","id":"169"}
{"text":"The programs that come standard with the Leopard running system are enough for the average person to run all the basics.","id":"2409"}
{"text":"I am really heartbroken to have to post a terrible review.","id":"1119"}
{"text":"So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the \"service\" when it is called the \"service center\".","id":"1322"}
{"text":"The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC  Specs: Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I've had in the past.","id":"1740"}
{"text":"It has been nothing but trouble from the time we bought it.","id":"2014"}
{"text":"After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15\" MBP i5.","id":"2239"}
{"text":"I am ADDICTED to photo booth!","id":"367"}
{"text":"The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.","id":"335"}
{"text":"So, I went back.","id":"1328"}
{"text":"I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.","id":"2652"}
{"text":"I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one.","id":"1384"}
{"text":"All in all great item highly recommend it.","id":"2831"}
{"text":"Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk.","id":"3042"}
{"text":"This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)!","id":"2263"}
{"text":"It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere.","id":"1481"}
{"text":"I don't have that additional money right now, and therefore wouldn't have purchased it at this time.","id":"2769"}
{"text":"First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.","id":"2491"}
{"text":"And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.","id":"1648"}
{"text":"Fast, fast and fast, the web pages just fly by.","id":"236"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I considered I may have too much on the computer, but after looking, there was plenty of space and that is not the issue.","id":"1869"}
{"text":"I don't use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so it's perfect for me.","id":"2763"}
{"text":"Guess I'll stay away from HP.","id":"1264"}
{"text":"It is made better, thicker, and all out tough!","id":"2882"}
{"text":"It was about six months later when the overheating problem started again, to the point it felt like fire on the bottom of the machine!","id":"955"}
{"text":"There is a blank lighted screen when I start and that is all.","id":"750"}
{"text":"And i would recommend this to anypne looking for a new laptop.","id":"1653"}
{"text":"But then, something goes wrong.","id":"1466"}
{"text":"So far so good with this laptop.","id":"2810"}
{"text":"\u00a0 i must keep it plugged in at all times because it will not keep a charge for longer than four minutes.","id":"1457"}
{"text":"Avoid this model.","id":"1165"}
{"text":"Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.","id":"763"}
{"text":"I saw walmart had the same computer for about $650 but still knowing what I know now,I would not buy it at that price.","id":"1977"}
{"text":"The local computer repair shops send out ads that say along the lines of we can fix almost any problem or computer\u00a0 usually even the trouble some\u00a0Toshiba satellite.","id":"1945"}
{"text":"it has had some problems.","id":"939"}
{"text":"Theres always something wrong with it, wether it be some virus you can't track down, or it overheats, sometimes even catches on fire, you just can't use it.","id":"1243"}
{"text":"This computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life.","id":"1387"}
{"text":"Of course, for a student, weight is always an issue.","id":"2156"}
{"text":"Now mainboard is broken, have to wait for a new one.","id":"626"}
{"text":"The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.","id":"3056"}
{"text":"2.The wireless card is low quality.","id":"1879"}
{"text":"This little netboook is helping me get work done!","id":"1806"}
{"text":"They also use two totally different operating systems.","id":"2121"}
{"text":"They are about the same size keys.","id":"2420"}
{"text":"I'm definitely not hard on laptops and guarantee 100% that no liquid has touched this machine in my presence.","id":"887"}
{"text":"I waited another month for approval and for them to \"BUILD\" me a new laptop.","id":"2039"}
{"text":"This ain't it.","id":"3032"}
{"text":"I wasn't really as concerned about portability (it's a very large laptop) but it's not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise.","id":"2107"}
{"text":"The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory.","id":"907"}
{"text":"They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba.","id":"160"}
{"text":"Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.","id":"254"}
{"text":"The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.","id":"2926"}
{"text":"Again- windows based machines were not giving me anything to work with!","id":"1632"}
{"text":"Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple.","id":"710"}
{"text":"I should have kept my big, old HP.","id":"1271"}
{"text":"everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.","id":"2142"}
{"text":"i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.","id":"348"}
{"text":"I am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.","id":"703"}
{"text":"You know, using the computer should be fun, not aggrevation, especially when you are playing games or working with photos.","id":"1377"}
{"text":"You just get a trial version either way.","id":"2562"}
{"text":"I'm all for saving money but Dell needs to step it up.","id":"992"}
{"text":"There are no viruses or spyware to worry about like on a Windows computer.","id":"2167"}
{"text":"great machine if you want to drop the cash for one.","id":"2635"}
{"text":"To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.","id":"2932"}
{"text":"I also love the small, convenient size of my laptop, making it a perfect tool for my academic studies.","id":"2904"}
{"text":"I never have had a good result with this computer.","id":"850"}
{"text":"I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).","id":"440"}
{"text":"YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET FOR.","id":"1882"}
{"text":"while about 8 years ago, I hope that the quality has changed.","id":"2671"}
{"text":"NO more Lenovo for me.","id":"1031"}
{"text":"I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.","id":"414"}
{"text":"However, a NETBOOK will be a different story.","id":"1286"}
{"text":"I'm glad I bought this laptop, it was worth the few ($100) extra dollars.","id":"2092"}
{"text":"The difference is it's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now, still learning the Apple navigation, but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps.","id":"1812"}
{"text":"I am a full Mac convert now.","id":"2599"}
{"text":"I highly recommend that you buy this product.","id":"573"}
{"text":"Though you get a polite person, you often don t get a solution.","id":"1198"}
{"text":"-I propose that I can just swap the hard drives.","id":"639"}
{"text":"It was old but it was not till we bought the Dell did we realize how great it was.","id":"1272"}
{"text":"The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.","id":"2311"}
{"text":"Sound card is limited though.","id":"2725"}
{"text":"I initially purchased my Macbook Pro 13\" in April, and I loved it.","id":"1147"}
{"text":"This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.","id":"671"}
{"text":"After much battling with HP i was able to return it 4 times for repairs.","id":"725"}
{"text":"So, you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item.","id":"175"}
{"text":"But let me tell you, the mac book pro is so professional.","id":"2580"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The only thing I can imagine is that Sony jumped on early specifications for Vista requirements from Microsoft and designed it to those inadequate requirements.","id":"831"}
{"text":"go for it!","id":"1816"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college.","id":"2269"}
{"text":"The keyboard, which generally felt okay even for someone used to a desktop keyboard, now looks terrible.","id":"111"}
{"text":"The display is awesome.","id":"1564"}
{"text":"After years of occasionally pulling my hair out fighting computer viruses, a good friend convinced me it was time to go the Apple route.","id":"1166"}
{"text":"The mouse is a little bit different than what you're used to though- it has one big flat panel and one full bar (instead of two separate ones) to click with- but you get used to it quite quickly.","id":"6"}
{"text":"It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.","id":"98"}
{"text":"However, this laptop has a fatal flaw that i discovered merely a week after buying it.","id":"656"}
{"text":"Perfect trifecta!","id":"2396"}
{"text":"The keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard.","id":"2584"}
{"text":"It was a huge monstrosity of a Laptop!","id":"492"}
{"text":"-Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.","id":"613"}
{"text":"-I propose that they can just swap the hard drives.","id":"637"}
{"text":"So don't get it.","id":"663"}
{"text":"it was a tough choice.","id":"2163"}
{"text":"Every driver on the drivers\/applications DVD is everything you will need for a reload.","id":"1061"}
{"text":"\u00a0 They sent it off and within 2 weeks I had it back good as new.","id":"943"}
{"text":"The Awesomest of the awesomest.","id":"1662"}
{"text":"One, owning a mac is essentially a full production studio (in the case of a mac book a portable version).","id":"2179"}
{"text":"I would like to tell you about the best laptop I just got from Mac.","id":"574"}
{"text":"I'm glad it waited, this one is great.","id":"2309"}
{"text":"I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot.","id":"1226"}
{"text":"(For those old enough to remember, it is similar to Beta versus VHS.","id":"1169"}
{"text":"It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.","id":"2627"}
{"text":"But, I would recommend this product.","id":"2743"}
{"text":"I know that ASUS is known for making motherboards, but this is the worst computer experience that I have ever had.","id":"1980"}
{"text":"If so, you may be having similar problems.","id":"1802"}
{"text":"Some days it's just blurry, some days it appears that it's raining on my nice desktop background of a lake and mountains.","id":"885"}
{"text":"This is a great machine!","id":"1537"}
{"text":"This is my first personal Satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous Satellite work issued laptops.","id":"3059"}
{"text":"We figure that after everything HIS pc actually ended up costing $350 more than my original Mac.","id":"2558"}
{"text":"So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.","id":"1026"}
{"text":"Peformance is good for the price.","id":"2694"}
{"text":"The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.","id":"1228"}
{"text":"I can see why the have soooo much money.","id":"376"}
{"text":"I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.","id":"776"}
{"text":"And Toshiba is totally unconcerned.","id":"1232"}
{"text":"Summary: HP knew they were shipping out bad BIOS and did nothing proactive to resolve it.","id":"755"}
{"text":"And in 6 months, there have been no freezing up and no blue, purple, black or any other type of screen.","id":"1640"}
{"text":"I had 3 months when the ports started going out.","id":"1947"}
{"text":"think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop.","id":"2841"}
{"text":"The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.","id":"3017"}
{"text":"I'll wait and save up for a new one.","id":"1836"}
{"text":"This laptop does everything I need it to very well.","id":"3069"}
{"text":"They are not.","id":"2441"}
{"text":"It makes sorting out all those photos on my digital camera a breeze, and organizing them by place, time taken, or sending them to an online print shop, or uploading them to Flickr or Facebook etc, is not hard at all.","id":"2604"}
{"text":"Its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop.","id":"437"}
{"text":"I bought it to use in college and it is perfect.","id":"3003"}
{"text":"It is super easy to use.","id":"319"}
{"text":"Many of my classmates computers hard drives crashed.","id":"1406"}
{"text":"Ease of use is just one of the benefits I love about my Mac.","id":"22"}
{"text":"I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out.","id":"2576"}
{"text":"The 13\" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.","id":"1775"}
{"text":"It took me a while top get away from the land of PCs, but now that I have, I can't see myself going back to it.","id":"382"}
{"text":"They discovered the manufacturer's defect and sent it in for repair.","id":"538"}
{"text":"The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!","id":"2279"}
{"text":"LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!","id":"20"}
{"text":"The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.","id":"2917"}
{"text":"The speakers on it are useless too.","id":"550"}
{"text":"You may soon mistake my digitus medius as a lively pogo stick.","id":"883"}
{"text":"This is not Best Buy's fault.","id":"1004"}
{"text":"I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident (long story).","id":"2068"}
{"text":"Most of my papers could not be saved and when they could be, half the time, the papers were then erased.","id":"1405"}
{"text":"I've had my MacBook Pro for three years now and still love it!","id":"590"}
{"text":"Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos.","id":"3076"}
{"text":"Exactly that, users.","id":"2403"}
{"text":"Iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites.","id":"1768"}
{"text":"I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.","id":"2651"}
{"text":"they will not let you down.","id":"565"}
{"text":"Almost 4 years ago I bought what was then the current, up to date HP Pavilion--If I recall correctly, it was the dv 1300 t.","id":"94"}
{"text":"It's not a recommendation, it' a plea.","id":"1044"}
{"text":"In early May I got it back and this time I only had it back for 1 day before it had a NEW issue so it was sent back in for the 6th time they \"expedited\" the repairs so I was only supposed to have to be without it for 3 days and it was supposed to be fixed, by a \"Senior Tech\".","id":"1936"}
{"text":"Some features arent friendly ( volume wheel, sound quality, etc.","id":"2859"}
{"text":"A cheaper price should not equal a \"cheap\" product.","id":"2745"}
{"text":"-When I started worrying for not hearing anything from them, I tried to call.","id":"616"}
{"text":"I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive, but I rather have a hard copy.","id":"2489"}
{"text":"got another 1, and same issue.","id":"736"}

{"text":"After a couple of years, my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a company-wide recall of my particular battery.","id":"593"}
{"text":"The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.","id":"354"}
{"text":"I would never buy a Dell again.","id":"65"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.","id":"2010"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The company sent me a whole new cord overnight and apologized.","id":"950"}
{"text":"It's even easy to hook up to other wireless networks.","id":"2761"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.","id":"822"}
{"text":"The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.","id":"771"}
{"text":"I am now frustrated that I still have to use my work issued Windows laptop!","id":"1642"}
{"text":"It gives me the power and speed that I need to run all the programs I use to edit.","id":"577"}
{"text":"iLife is easily compatible with Microsoft Office so you can send and receive files from a PC.","id":"2247"}
{"text":"They don't crash.","id":"1523"}
{"text":"As a computer science student in college, I find that the portability, longevity, and ease of use of this computer make me (shockingly) want to do homework more;","id":"2267"}
{"text":"This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.","id":"252"}
{"text":"I love this little one.","id":"683"}
{"text":"So not having my laptop was discouraging.","id":"1932"}
{"text":"I fine Apple MC373LL\/A 2.66GHz 15\" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go.","id":"601"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Again I sent it back and they replaced the motherboard and some fan inside.","id":"945"}
{"text":"Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.","id":"2160"}
{"text":"It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.","id":"1501"}
{"text":"1st hand experience is very important, especially for a new customer.","id":"1333"}
{"text":"I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!","id":"2222"}
{"text":"Even though it is much more expensive than many PC laptops, it is worth the price.","id":"2254"}
{"text":"I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price, and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls.","id":"290"}
{"text":"For me, keys were starting to get stuck and wouldn't type very well.","id":"1467"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.","id":"856"}

{"text":"However, this will be my last as well.","id":"1335"}
{"text":"There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: \" Consider replacing your battery\" and it does not hold full charge.","id":"255"}
{"text":"SO? HOW CAN YOU SOLVE IT? C'mon, I just bought the netbook 2 weeks ago.","id":"1305"}
{"text":"The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.","id":"395"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great laptop, you've found the best here.","id":"1815"}
{"text":"The first programm I switched on was a game for my children.","id":"1104"}
{"text":"I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop.","id":"2922"}
{"text":"I have had my MacBook for almost 6 months and can honestly say that I will NEVER buy another computer if it is not a Mac.","id":"1821"}
{"text":"I've always owned a PC and decided to try a MacBook to see what it's all about.","id":"689"}
{"text":"On two occasions the computer s calendar told me it was 1969.","id":"1200"}
{"text":"I bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her, it's very lightweight, and the response for the computing she's doing (Internet focused activity: mail, research, etc.) is excellent;","id":"2398"}
{"text":"Its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer.","id":"2581"}
{"text":"Overall, this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase!","id":"2361"}
{"text":"It came alot faster than I thought it would have which was really exciting.","id":"487"}
{"text":"Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.","id":"801"}
{"text":"It is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed.","id":"1766"}
{"text":"also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.","id":"2236"}
{"text":"But if you are in the computer field you probably wouldn't be here.","id":"323"}
{"text":"The great 18 month same as cash financing and Advance Protection Plan which includes accidents like spills .","id":"1518"}
{"text":"I could not handle it one hand like I can the replacement computer I purchased.","id":"1965"}
{"text":"The new Macbook Pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing.","id":"294"}
{"text":"i would never go back any more, i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone.","id":"2136"}
{"text":"they respond: \"your dissatisfaction is noted\"...","id":"646"}
{"text":"I was even able to uninstall McAffe and install one of my Symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever.","id":"28"}
{"text":"( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection).","id":"1717"}
{"text":"I did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements, but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before I purchased.","id":"2766"}
{"text":"Also the display is exceptional!","id":"448"}
{"text":"This is still a fairly good upgrade to a laptop that was about 4 years old.","id":"2681"}
{"text":"The computer was shipped to their repair depot\u00a0 on june 24 and returned on July 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned.","id":"1225"}
{"text":"This is basically the best laptop I have ever had or used.","id":"2277"}
{"text":"(3DMARK6 score is only 8500).","id":"1077"}
{"text":"I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.","id":"2885"}
{"text":"So honestly, I wasn't expecting anything less than perfection, and I wasn't disappointed.","id":"2287"}
{"text":"Learning all of the keyboard shortcuts only took a few minutes to get used to as some of the shortcuts are the same on Windows machines.","id":"207"}
{"text":"My friends are in awe every time they come over!","id":"1664"}
{"text":"little short on RAM but you get what you pay for.","id":"2805"}
{"text":"It didn't come with any software installed outside of windows media, but for the price, I was very pleased with the condition and the overall product.","id":"1819"}
{"text":"The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro.","id":"3013"}
{"text":"THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went.","id":"904"}
{"text":"2nd Mac book I have purchased from MacConnection.","id":"1624"}
{"text":"I love a \"pc\" but I was ready for a change and tired of the windows system.","id":"2093"}
{"text":"Your cursor will end up all over the freaking place,,,it's not uncommon for me to accidentally delete words, sentences, paragraphs because of this mousepad.","id":"890"}
{"text":"Other installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.","id":"722"}
{"text":"I normally dont participate in reviews\/surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts...","id":"3066"}
{"text":"Most of the large bags are for a 17 inch.","id":"2432"}
{"text":"I work in film editing and post production, so I need a laptop that not only has power, but memory and speed as well.","id":"575"}
{"text":"I took it home and within 30 min, it was freezing up and did the \"blue screen of death\".","id":"1629"}
{"text":"At first when I got this product, I loved it.","id":"898"}
{"text":"I think this computer is super lame.","id":"281"}
{"text":"It had a seventeen inch screen which I wanted, but I didn't realize at the time it would be such a monster!","id":"494"}
{"text":"Even doing so, the hinge may just be slightly tightened only.","id":"1310"}
{"text":"company provides UPS shipping, fast, great!","id":"1570"}
{"text":"I would tell the technician I knew\u00a0exactly\u00a0what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.","id":"1020"}
{"text":"THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.","id":"1559"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Then I've fixed the DC jack (inside the unit), rewired the DC jack to the OUTside of the laptop, replaced the power brick.","id":"982"}
{"text":"I purchased two laptops (for my husband and 16 year old daughter).","id":"2983"}
{"text":"More relieved than anything.","id":"528"}
{"text":"It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.","id":"1783"}
{"text":"Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.","id":"2090"}
{"text":"Summary: Spend your money elsewhere","id":"545"}
{"text":"believe me apple has a reputation.","id":"564"}
{"text":"The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.","id":"597"}
{"text":"The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.","id":"454"}
{"text":"The shop will definitely push the problem to the service center.","id":"1321"}
{"text":"PC users work in Word, while Mac users work in Pages.","id":"2507"}
{"text":"I am able to organize my pics, music and files easily.","id":"370"}
{"text":"While I mostly use it for email, internet and gaming, I'm confident all other applications live up to the high standard I've come to appreciate from Mac laptops.","id":"84"}
{"text":"I've been having endless problems since I bought the computer - only 1 month ago","id":"2058"}
{"text":"The perfect notebook...","id":"742"}
{"text":"This laptop looks great on the surface: 17\" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.","id":"834"}
{"text":"The apple systems are over priced luxurys that arn't worth what they are being charged for, this model's specifications are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name.","id":"1449"}
{"text":"My mac laptop is fabulous in both areas.","id":"576"}
{"text":"pros:  the macbook pro notebook has a large battery life and you wont have to worry to charge your laptop every five hours or so.","id":"566"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this product!","id":"598"}
{"text":"Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price","id":"983"}
{"text":"So far, it's an average laptop - no better, no worse than the HP I replaced.","id":"1421"}
{"text":"The only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible.","id":"2975"}
{"text":"Good price.","id":"2684"}
{"text":"\u00a0THE MOTHERBOARD IS DEAD !","id":"918"}
{"text":"I wanted to spend around $700 to $800 so I was directed to a nice looking HP Laptop.","id":"1628"}
{"text":"the speed is fine.","id":"2144"}
{"text":"I was starting to boil.","id":"1298"}
{"text":"Hmmm - that high failure rate sure isn't reflected in the retail price.","id":"1361"}
{"text":"BAck she goes!","id":"748"}
{"text":"It was not clear that the Microsoft Student Edition that was loaded on the computer, was a six month trial.","id":"2784"}
{"text":"not the day received.","id":"794"}
{"text":"Good for every day computing and web browsing.","id":"1805"}
{"text":"While lacking some of the functions of the other versions, this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer.","id":"2597"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.","id":"821"}
{"text":"It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.","id":"1027"}
{"text":"It is by far one of the greatest investments I have ever made.","id":"1737"}
{"text":"If you are a PC user looking to convert I would HIGHLY recommend it!","id":"364"}
{"text":"Excellent LED monitor and well equipped.","id":"441"}
{"text":"\u00a0 This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.","id":"1913"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the *design* of this laptop is fantastic.","id":"1793"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.","id":"378"}
{"text":"I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any memory left.","id":"1412"}
{"text":"I've had my Macbook Pro since August 2009.","id":"304"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the laptop I purchased was also a Dell and again, I have to say i hated it.","id":"473"}
{"text":"Took a while to clean it up to my specs.","id":"2678"}
{"text":"They are so realistic I am just speechless.","id":"1677"}
{"text":"Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.","id":"2963"}
{"text":"This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years, I find not much difference except of course for the screen size.","id":"568"}
{"text":"But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24\/7.","id":"1202"}
{"text":"There are differences that you need to know and take time to learn.","id":"1829"}
{"text":"They have more problems then a 1980's computer.","id":"1944"}
{"text":"It is amazing.","id":"1579"}
{"text":"Needless to say, not to happy with the product.","id":"1220"}
{"text":"The cool thing about this is anyone can use it.","id":"1679"}
{"text":"My first laptop was an Acer that I got for Christmas.","id":"1463"}
{"text":"Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.","id":"339"}
{"text":"the internet can be an scary place its up to you on what you do with it.","id":"562"}
{"text":"The backlit keys are wonderful when you are working in the dark.","id":"1491"}
{"text":"I chose the iBookG4, a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large screen big enough to please anyone.","id":"1171"}
{"text":"The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead.","id":"1727"}
{"text":"I would \u00a0say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.","id":"181"}
{"text":"Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing, but very easy to use.","id":"2503"}
{"text":"I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.","id":"3031"}
{"text":"The Macbooks worth every penny.","id":"1516"}
{"text":"I did not have to call the support line at all.","id":"2970"}
{"text":"The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the Windows 7 starter and not the full Windows 7.","id":"1483"}
{"text":"THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FUNCTION IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY.","id":"1084"}
{"text":"The DVD drive randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well, which is annoying.","id":"120"}
{"text":"Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.","id":"1658"}
{"text":"I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly.","id":"3004"}
{"text":"The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.","id":"2894"}
{"text":"But if you can't make your product last more than a year, you will not get my business again.","id":"1448"}
{"text":"There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system can't be used with the iBook.","id":"1716"}
{"text":"Seems like maybe a bad shipment from Toshiba.","id":"2734"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money!","id":"257"}
{"text":"Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.","id":"176"}
{"text":"-Managed to send complaint email.","id":"632"}
{"text":"however, they were kind enough to send a replacement free of charge.","id":"1755"}
{"text":"Seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the Dell","id":"686"}
{"text":"OS X is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time.","id":"2315"}
{"text":"I do everything on this computer - check email, facebook, shop, check blogs, write papers, listen to music, and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv.","id":"2609"}
{"text":"I thought it would be a simple job.","id":"1290"}
{"text":"But other than that I am blown away by all the features this laptop offers.","id":"1567"}
{"text":"I Hate it!","id":"52"}
{"text":"Don't buy this model.","id":"1111"}
{"text":"The keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops I have had in the past.","id":"387"}
{"text":"I can leave my MacBook uncharged for upwards of eight hours and it won't even be dead.","id":"2175"}
{"text":"Overall, this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from.","id":"8"}
{"text":"I do find that my MacBook has a lot more bells and whistles than a normal PC especially if you enjoy technology, downloading pictures and graphic design.","id":"1832"}
{"text":"First the screen goes completely out.","id":"403"}
{"text":"I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.","id":"2350"}
{"text":"I love this 13\" Mac white unibody.","id":"2078"}
{"text":"the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon!","id":"346"}
{"text":"When I am at Starbucks between clients I get full bars on my HP and 1 bar on my Eee PC.","id":"1881"}
{"text":"The PhotoBooth is a great program, it takes very good pictures with the built-in camera.","id":"1497"}
{"text":"And inconvenient!","id":"498"}
{"text":"Many kinds of software that is necessary to the working person is not available and cannot be downloaded.","id":"280"}
{"text":"It is so speedy.","id":"2312"}
{"text":"Needs constant repair.","id":"402"}
{"text":"I will never purchase a HP again ever.","id":"127"}
{"text":"I had to pay for the shipping!","id":"1012"}
{"text":"It bluescreened on me without any warning, running simply basic Chrome.","id":"657"}
{"text":"This is another reason to like the Mac.","id":"2418"}
{"text":"I took 3-4 years researching brands and prices of laptops.","id":"2764"}
{"text":"One bad thing is it gets hot.","id":"2324"}
{"text":"I'm stuck w\/ a broken computer.","id":"2720"}
{"text":"We researched and found the best price at MacConnection.","id":"2149"}
{"text":"Hope this helps!","id":"1475"}
{"text":"But guess what?  (you have to buy an external dvd drive it doesn't have a built in type) The notebook can't be used because it doesn't read anything for an external drive.","id":"926"}
{"text":"GET THIS COMPUTER FOR PORTABILITY AND FAST PROCESSING!!!","id":"682"}
{"text":"Apparently they're not special anymore .","id":"516"}
{"text":"I use a cooling pad but it doesn't help.","id":"871"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC!!!","id":"691"}
{"text":"99 to  fix it.","id":"841"}
{"text":"Few viruses to catch;","id":"1702"}
{"text":"Supplied software: The software that comes with this machine is greatly welcomed compared to what Windows comes with.","id":"1744"}
{"text":"Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.","id":"423"}
{"text":"I'm tired of the inept service.","id":"773"}
{"text":"Garageband is easy to work with, like all the other apple applications I've had experience with.","id":"1659"}
{"text":"No, tey don't even support their own bios and it \"could be a problem with the bios\" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!","id":"746"}
{"text":"While many people brag about Mac being \"intuitive\", it does take a little time to adjust to coming from a PC, but once I got the hang of it, I don't want to go back.","id":"2475"}
{"text":"Because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time, we are on the hook for the repair.","id":"1358"}
{"text":"It started out by randomly ceasing to charge when it was plugged in (mousing over the battery icon would read, for example, \"74%, plugged in, not charging\"), requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in several times to get it to charge.","id":"108"}
{"text":"This laptop looked brand new and was shipped very quickly.","id":"1818"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something reliable, this is the laptop for you.","id":"2253"}
{"text":"Info: Windows failed to load because the kernal is missing, or corrupt.","id":"1112"}
{"text":"The display on this computer is the best I've seen in a very long time, the battery life is very long and very convienent.","id":"1576"}
{"text":"Most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on.","id":"2467"}
{"text":"We didn't because it was already over 2,400 dollars!","id":"491"}
{"text":"But the quality, in general was less than the worth of the cheap laptop.","id":"1409"}
{"text":"In the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced.","id":"458"}
{"text":"Its also FUN to use!","id":"1530"}
{"text":"The graphics and screen are stunning and although I was a PC person, I was able to understand how to use a mac fairly quickly.","id":"1612"}
{"text":"WIth the upgraded memory, the MacBook Pro never has an issue running many many applications at once!","id":"2273"}
{"text":"Simple to use, and great graphics.","id":"2824"}
{"text":"It still serves me well both in business and home needs.","id":"2519"}
{"text":"I use my friends and family's $2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and HP, well, I'll never buy or recommend an HP to anyone!","id":"2045"}
{"text":"My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made.","id":"1725"}
{"text":"The internet speed is spectacular.","id":"2934"}
{"text":"They claim call center is still down.","id":"624"}
{"text":"Mac also has many apps and programs that are quite cheap or free.","id":"2408"}
{"text":"If you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal.","id":"428"}
{"text":"I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues!","id":"2883"}
{"text":"You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it.","id":"221"}
{"text":"My house is now 100% Macbook.","id":"1557"}
{"text":"They're not safe, they're not durable, they just a worthless.","id":"1246"}
{"text":"My husband uses it mostly for games, email and music.","id":"2984"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.","id":"819"}
{"text":"I just took the broken cords into the Apple store and they gave me new ones.","id":"2565"}
{"text":"My Mac is much more efficient than a PC so it does not need the extra bells and whistles to compete.","id":"2120"}
{"text":"It WORKS!","id":"1554"}
{"text":"You just lose a customer.","id":"1339"}
{"text":"I ve had several calls lasting more than an hour with promises to call back, but the return calls never came.","id":"1199"}
{"text":"Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.","id":"909"}
{"text":"Being a PC user my whole life, it's taking a bit of time to adapt to the OS of a Mac but I'm finding my way around.","id":"2347"}
{"text":"The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.","id":"1470"}
{"text":"I have in the past gotten superfine sandpaper and \"fixed\" the edges by rounding them off.","id":"1601"}
{"text":"I hate it!","id":"499"}
{"text":"returned it.","id":"1210"}
{"text":"Downfalls: sharp edges.","id":"1747"}
{"text":"It is a cheap throw together.","id":"2920"}
{"text":"i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria.","id":"2537"}
{"text":"I would recommend Mac, and do, to anyone looking to buy a new computer.","id":"2606"}
{"text":"The screen is gorgeous - yummy good.","id":"2322"}
{"text":"Did I mention everything about it, from size to weight to keyboard screams BULK?","id":"1129"}
{"text":"Can't wait until I go on vacation and take it with me.","id":"2218"}
{"text":"Good bye BLUE SCREEN and Critical errors!!!!","id":"239"}
{"text":"I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.","id":"941"}
{"text":"So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.","id":"1154"}
{"text":"Once again, I was told it was the suspicious  power supply  problem.","id":"1201"}
{"text":"It easily fits into most computer bags but doesn't weigh down a backpack or satchel when being carried with spirals and\/or textbooks.","id":"2158"}
{"text":"The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3\" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.","id":"1558"}
{"text":"It was kind of a rebellion against PC in fact, and I am certainly glad I did.","id":"2601"}
{"text":"Unable to boot up this brand new laptop.","id":"462"}
{"text":"In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.","id":"2248"}
{"text":"\u00a0I actually had the hard drive replaced twice, the mother board once, the dvd drive twice, then they FINALLY agreed to replace it, (ALL OF THIS IN LESS THAN 1 1\/2 YEARS!","id":"1097"}
{"text":"I really don't like it, but I am stuck.","id":"148"}
{"text":"The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the \"repair\".","id":"1308"}
{"text":"The port is secured to motherboard so when this  happens you can't see the plug at all, it's just gone.","id":"838"}
{"text":"-Stay away from MacHouse Amsterdam.","id":"649"}

{"text":"I love windows 7 but i can't give Toshiba any credit for that, unless y'all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time.","id":"2809"}
{"text":"Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more.","id":"299"}
{"text":"After numerous calls to Applecare tech support, I was directed to send in my computer;","id":"1163"}

{"text":"The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it.","id":"234"}
{"text":"i would have to say that overall its great!","id":"2818"}
{"text":"There are no gold key numbers too intall programs, you must use the serial numbers that it does not accept and then things are limited as far a working because they are only good for a short time.","id":"2952"}
{"text":"and they replaced the awesome ergonomic small lightweight power supply with a power supply that weighed more than the machine itself.","id":"879"}
{"text":"It's the inside that is truly wonderful.","id":"2289"}
{"text":"Enjoy that Toshib force and durability unparalleled","id":"1592"}
{"text":"I purchased this laptop 9 months ago!","id":"780"}

{"text":"Returning this as soon as I get out of work","id":"166"}
{"text":"I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers.","id":"706"}
{"text":"This unit is not.","id":"2468"}
{"text":"We love the size of the screen, although it is still lightweight and very easy to tote around.","id":"2482"}
{"text":"They aren't worth the money, even though they are on the cheap side, laptop speaking.","id":"1245"}
{"text":"Either way the entire thing was just a joke, a complete rip off!","id":"522"}
{"text":"so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.","id":"795"}
{"text":"So glad I decided to upgrade!","id":"1714"}
{"text":"I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.","id":"326"}

{"text":"*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD LAPTOP, THIS IS NOT IT!","id":"805"}
{"text":"If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more.","id":"2084"}
{"text":"It's catatonic.","id":"1156"}
{"text":"I have never really been big on downloading anything so I wasn't too worried about getting a virus, plus I thought I was protected by Norton.","id":"503"}
{"text":"The internet was locekd and froze every time it was trying to be used, and the command prompt would not work at all.","id":"277"}
{"text":"It's software and speed enable it to do amazing things.","id":"2105"}
{"text":"The Toshiba Satellite laptop is  DESIGNED  to fail !","id":"1416"}

{"text":"My wireless provider confirmed my home internet is fine, and any connections I turn on should work.","id":"1883"}
{"text":"Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.","id":"1268"}
{"text":"I could have purchased a cheap computer to do what I'm doing now!","id":"972"}
{"text":"I am most impressed with the programming, including the iPhoto.","id":"2603"}
{"text":"Speakers too small to be of any real use.","id":"213"}
{"text":"I upgraded it's RAM to 2GB, I am very happy with it.","id":"2621"}
{"text":"This is a great computer.","id":"2658"}
{"text":"I purchased a Toshiba Satellite M60 (with harman\/kardon speakers!) in December of 2005.","id":"2518"}
{"text":"Dismantle the whole thing? Then it will not be a newly manufactured set like before.","id":"1312"}
{"text":"They should have included more memory on their computers if they knew Vista would run slowly.","id":"62"}
{"text":"Battery life could be better but overall for the price and Toshiba's reputation for laptops it's great!","id":"445"}
{"text":"The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.","id":"90"}
{"text":"It wouldn't fit in most 17-inch bags.","id":"2434"}
{"text":"The first time it crashed was maybe going on a year and a half of having it.","id":"502"}
{"text":"\u00a0 After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.","id":"1366"}
{"text":"I paid $800 for this computer from my school campus bookstore.","id":"1975"}
{"text":"It is small enough to fit in one of my purses!","id":"24"}
{"text":"The Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics.","id":"1542"}
{"text":"I was very worried about making the two compatible- but literally, it was so simple I was almost worried that I was doing something wrong.","id":"2195"}
{"text":"Note that I don't ordinarily take the time to write a review.","id":"2343"}
{"text":"The neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons.","id":"456"}
{"text":"I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.","id":"1892"}
{"text":"Apparently well-built and gorgeous to look at, the i5 MacBook Pro is a winning combination of price and performance.","id":"1548"}
{"text":"ASUS has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks, and I would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them.","id":"1547"}
{"text":"The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.","id":"582"}
{"text":"Buyer Beware.","id":"2856"}
{"text":"It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part.","id":"2958"}
{"text":"The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried.","id":"2875"}
{"text":"So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.","id":"901"}
{"text":"So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.","id":"2880"}
{"text":"do not buy you will be disappointed.","id":"1395"}
{"text":"I just recently had to ship my laptop back to HP for repair.","id":"1010"}
{"text":"I have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months!","id":"804"}
{"text":"We don't Mind and You don't Matter.","id":"1234"}
{"text":"I love the size, keyboard, the functions.","id":"2393"}
{"text":"But as time went on I found it almost impossible to keep the thing on-line through wi-fi.","id":"1261"}
{"text":"the mouse is way way way to sensitve.","id":"2837"}
{"text":"Toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it.","id":"1442"}
{"text":"The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.","id":"2547"}
{"text":"Also, I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the screen, which is noticable to me.","id":"1070"}
{"text":"Waited on getting this computer, but it has been a great change.","id":"21"}
{"text":"After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.","id":"99"}
{"text":"My friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance, picture quality, and ease of use.","id":"1480"}
{"text":"the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.","id":"3078"}
{"text":"I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC.","id":"707"}
{"text":"Enjoy your sitdown","id":"897"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.","id":"2009"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad, keys, and casing.","id":"963"}
{"text":"I have had my new Macbook Pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled ALL of my old PC laptops.","id":"86"}
{"text":"See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it.","id":"1645"}
{"text":"The only thing I don't understand is that the resolution of the screen isn't high enough for some pages, such as Yahoo!Mail.","id":"2792"}
{"text":"The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16\" laptop does.","id":"2575"}
{"text":"very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...","id":"571"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely.","id":"2011"}
{"text":"This is great if you have several lectures back to back and don't have a chance to charge during one of the lectures.","id":"2161"}
{"text":"I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff.","id":"3080"}
{"text":"At first it's like you're in that honeymoon stage with your laptop.","id":"1464"}

{"text":"My laptop cost approximately $2,300 and DIED after only 2-years, 10-months and 18-days of use.","id":"396"}

{"text":"I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.","id":"2061"}
{"text":"This computer was bought because I wanted \"top of the line\", fast, reliable, HA.","id":"1094"}

{"text":"The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.","id":"1052"}

{"text":"I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus.","id":"297"}
{"text":"I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so\u00a0carrying\u00a0it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.","id":"1025"}
{"text":"Right size and weight for portability.","id":"2990"}
{"text":"We decided we would try to trade-in our old ones.","id":"2555"}
{"text":"So far, so good!","id":"2384"}
{"text":"It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.","id":"2929"}
{"text":"Eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on.","id":"1262"}
{"text":"The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.","id":"701"}
{"text":"\u00a0 It was loaded with Windows Vista Home Premium--delivered with only 1GB of RAM, and it was a *dog*.","id":"828"}
{"text":"What a waste of time it was to run a Defrag on the PC!","id":"2411"}
{"text":"The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.","id":"3023"}
{"text":"My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.","id":"2961"}
{"text":"This system is not worth the money or trouble trying to get it fix.","id":"133"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Two years after buying this laptop, I am now the proud owner of a lemon.","id":"1162"}
{"text":"While it was highly rated, would I like it? I tried the keyboard at the store, and it seemed ok.","id":"2329"}
{"text":"Treat yourself to a more expensive, long-lasting laptop of quality like a Sony, Apple, or Toshiba.","id":"2000"}
{"text":"I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.","id":"2204"}
{"text":"We did not even have it a year.","id":"1269"}
{"text":"I have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free, even without the warranty.","id":"1528"}
{"text":"So you out of of notebook and money.","id":"928"}
{"text":"Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site.","id":"772"}
{"text":"But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.","id":"1502"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.","id":"858"}
{"text":"(No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.","id":"1173"}
{"text":"And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.","id":"1647"}
{"text":"The one thing I wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel.","id":"2488"}
{"text":"I edit and burn to DVD a lot of video, so I obviously could not live with a non-functioning drive.","id":"1995"}
{"text":"Fast, great visual!","id":"2820"}
{"text":"It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.","id":"2083"}

{"text":"apple and quess what, you have to send the whole laptop in, too bad, so sad","id":"261"}
{"text":"If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.","id":"3038"}
{"text":"might have to buy one for me now, since I use it all the time.","id":"1814"}
{"text":"while the keyboard itself is alright, the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.","id":"2782"}
{"text":"I purchased it this year when my old HP laptop finally died and I was looking for something smaller and lighter than a laptop to carry around for classes and traveling.","id":"468"}
{"text":"I Have a friend who has the other model and we put them side by side with the same dvd in (battle of the Smithsonian) After on Hour mine was at 53% life left and his was at 69% life left.","id":"1092"}
{"text":"The latest is on my LG Netbook X12","id":"1280"}
{"text":"Purchased as a gift for a friend.","id":"1478"}
{"text":"I would not recommend the purchase of this modle of Toshiba Computer or any Toshiba product for that matter.","id":"1235"}
{"text":"I've never had problems with viruses.","id":"1773"}
{"text":"After they found no other way, they told me to courier it to them(since they don't allow the use of the post office) at my expense, and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn't be covered.","id":"1854"}
{"text":"There are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new MacBook!","id":"1511"}
{"text":"the mcbook pro notebook will make it easy for you to write and read your emails at blazing speeds.","id":"563"}
{"text":"The only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time.","id":"2668"}
{"text":"However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.","id":"1535"}
{"text":"Battery life needs more life.","id":"2991"}
{"text":"For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.","id":"132"}
{"text":"I had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly.","id":"1011"}
{"text":"I am going to go back and return at Store I bought from!","id":"466"}
{"text":"The trackpad was easy to learn and navigate.","id":"208"}
{"text":"Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.","id":"2314"}
{"text":"My husband purchased a laptop at the same time for about $300 less (he got a pc).","id":"2552"}
{"text":"I respond that I do not have the old computer and this way I would lose the data on my hard drive.","id":"634"}
{"text":"Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English.","id":"1926"}
{"text":"I think this ps was manufactured in the mid 90's.","id":"880"}
{"text":"both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary Product Key.","id":"721"}
{"text":"I have owned it only two months!","id":"2849"}
{"text":"I love my macbook pro!","id":"360"}
{"text":"From the moment I opened the box to the present it has been a great joy.","id":"1572"}
{"text":"I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highly\u00a0dissatisfied with it.","id":"247"}
{"text":"Even though the computer is larger they did not make the keyboard larger.","id":"2417"}
{"text":"Thanks, MacConnection, for making this a seamless purchase!","id":"1715"}
{"text":"We paid for the three year warranty and the extended warranty after that one ended as well.","id":"500"}
{"text":"Its not just slow on the internet, its slow in general.","id":"859"}
{"text":"It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.","id":"1504"}
{"text":"The difference is phenomenal.","id":"2474"}
{"text":"I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.","id":"158"}

{"text":"No waiting to have my claim reviewed by someone in another state (or more often, another country).","id":"2567"}
{"text":"I did not like my acer.","id":"1961"}
{"text":"My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days.","id":"2879"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Problem fixed which is great but there went another two weeks without my laptop at school.","id":"946"}
{"text":"The resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market.","id":"1565"}
{"text":"Then just the other day, my left \"mouse\" button snapped!","id":"2854"}
{"text":"It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.","id":"2585"}
{"text":"Laptop is advertised as a 15\" but the casing looks like that of a 17\".","id":"2692"}
{"text":"\u00a0 Remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product.","id":"1146"}
{"text":"I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.","id":"413"}
{"text":"The only time I have restarted is during system updates.","id":"2634"}
{"text":"mac is extremely different than any other laptop.","id":"2232"}
{"text":"The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.","id":"3018"}
{"text":"In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.","id":"49"}
{"text":"It's great and we will always stick with Apple computers, we have been so happy with them.","id":"2614"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I should have realized that trouble was brewing .","id":"981"}
{"text":"They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.","id":"259"}
{"text":"Thank you.","id":"2774"}
{"text":"The benefits were immediate!","id":"2256"}
{"text":"Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.","id":"1550"}
{"text":"Never any doubt I would get a MacBook, just wasn't sure which one.","id":"1721"}
{"text":"But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.","id":"2146"}
{"text":"the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.","id":"1399"}
{"text":"The overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she'd recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook.","id":"2400"}
{"text":"I bought my Acer Aspire custom made in June 2008.","id":"1917"}
{"text":"I guess he was the technical person.","id":"1302"}
{"text":"They click.","id":"2815"}
{"text":"A seventy dollar mouse!","id":"534"}
{"text":"The repairs were made quickly though I must say, however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me.","id":"429"}
{"text":"I have the A65 - right now it's a paperweight.","id":"978"}
{"text":"when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.","id":"2301"}
{"text":"That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.","id":"2087"}
{"text":"It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.","id":"2378"}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.","id":"2722"}
{"text":"But when I received my replacement, I made BOTH recovery DVDs (4), and a driver\/application DVD.","id":"1058"}
{"text":"In addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.","id":"2252"}
{"text":"The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.","id":"2781"}
{"text":"So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).","id":"927"}
{"text":"What's really great about this product is you may have a family member who is computer illiterate and you can pretty much just let them loose on this computer without any real supervision.","id":"2293"}
{"text":"The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.","id":"424"}
{"text":"PDF files can be viewed instantly.","id":"2316"}
{"text":"Dell Latitude d620 is not a reliable machine.","id":"2008"}
{"text":"I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it.","id":"1726"}
{"text":"Overall for the money this is a good deal.","id":"2779"}
{"text":"It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.","id":"2955"}
{"text":"I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.","id":"2697"}
{"text":"I saved for this laptop for 3 months and I can tell you personally it was worth the wait.","id":"1575"}
{"text":"I own a Hewlett Packard laptop and I've had man problems with it since I bought in in Feb, 201","id":"1007"}
{"text":"\u00a0  It has a overheating issue - nearly to the point of being dangerous.","id":"979"}
{"text":"I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.","id":"2357"}
{"text":"EITHER WAY, THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY.","id":"1087"}
{"text":"Well, I have to say since I bought my Mac, I won't ever go back to any Windows.","id":"2529"}
{"text":"I took it in to the Apple store and guess what? They fixed it, no cost out of pocket.","id":"2111"}
{"text":"I have used different laptops in the past and I have to rate this one way above the rest.","id":"71"}
{"text":"I love the Mac so much better than my work PC!","id":"1619"}
{"text":"The quality, engineering design and warranty are superior--covers damage from dropping the laptop.","id":"400"}
{"text":"I recommend the Macbook Pro if you want the best laptop on the market.","id":"2628"}
{"text":"The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.","id":"2212"}
{"text":"The large screen gives you the option to comfortably watch movies or TV shows on your computer instead of buying an additional TV for your dorm room.","id":"2153"}
{"text":"Small and light weight.","id":"212"}
{"text":"Great laptop for school, easy to use for beginners in the household.","id":"443"}
{"text":"He didn't work for sony, he was just approved to fix their crappy products.","id":"511"}
{"text":"4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...","id":"194"}
{"text":"The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.","id":"2620"}
{"text":"Bought for my daughter to take for starting college this fall - she has been on it non-stop ever since \"learning how to use it\".","id":"1593"}
{"text":"Never had a single problem, and don't have to worry about viruses.","id":"83"}
{"text":"Of course, I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others.","id":"1299"}
{"text":"Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.","id":"366"}
{"text":"Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make\/model).","id":"2686"}
{"text":"It is SO much fun to play with.","id":"368"}
{"text":"If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!","id":"784"}
{"text":"*6th week*-They are not responding to my emails asking when they expect to dispatch the new unit...","id":"647"}
{"text":"All of the programs (Keynote, Pages, Numbers) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible, which really eliminates the need for the actual.","id":"1496"}
{"text":"Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.","id":"2602"}
{"text":"The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google \"dell coupons\" you can find codes that take a signifant\u00a0 amount off the price.","id":"1450"}
{"text":"There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.","id":"1410"}
{"text":"And Toshiba is a quality supplier.","id":"688"}
{"text":"For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000","id":"2097"}
{"text":"I can't honestly say I was heartbroken.","id":"527"}
{"text":"WILL NOT EVERY BUY ANOTHER--------LOU","id":"2665"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.","id":"1795"}
{"text":"and finally i realized that mac is the best.","id":"2230"}
{"text":"It's very annoying.","id":"114"}
{"text":"I'm hoping that I can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross.","id":"2224"}
{"text":"My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.","id":"3033"}
{"text":"I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.","id":"1614"}
{"text":"I'm Very disappointed in Dell.","id":"1003"}
{"text":"sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.","id":"1392"}
{"text":"I've only had mine a day but I'm already used to it...","id":"680"}
{"text":"And that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed.","id":"436"}
{"text":"The 13\" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.","id":"697"}
{"text":"I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.","id":"1159"}
{"text":"I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.","id":"2757"}
{"text":"For me, five stars is not enough.","id":"232"}
{"text":"I love how easy every thing is to do on my Apple products.","id":"2122"}
{"text":"Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros.","id":"1508"}
{"text":"The layout of the MacBook is horrible and confusing;","id":"278"}
{"text":"Was not happy with one of the programs on it.","id":"2783"}
{"text":"Also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable, easy to use computer.","id":"327"}
{"text":"The first one sent: Touchpad didn't work The second sent: USB didn't work The third sent: Touchpad didn't work The fourth sent: Hasn't arrived yet.","id":"2731"}
{"text":"I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop.","id":"218"}
{"text":"This is definitely a computer worth the money;","id":"5"}
{"text":"Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.","id":"1749"}
{"text":"\u00a0 I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.","id":"820"}
{"text":"It is light and the battery last a very long time.","id":"245"}
{"text":"Better stick with another brand.","id":"1979"}
{"text":"I am glad I did my research.","id":"202"}
{"text":"\u00a0 And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).","id":"1142"}
{"text":"5 months dead again.","id":"1211"}
{"text":"Also, you won't have to worry about them going onlne a getting a virus.","id":"2294"}
{"text":"Very happy.","id":"1583"}
{"text":"The netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me.","id":"2372"}
{"text":"Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.","id":"1438"}
{"text":"My children won't even use it\u00a0 for their school work.","id":"1949"}
{"text":"THIS LAPTOP WAS BAD FROM THE FIRST DAY OF USE----BROUGHT IT BACK TO STORE FOR RETURN OF MONEY.","id":"2663"}
{"text":"The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.","id":"952"}
{"text":"The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.","id":"1858"}
{"text":"also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had","id":"2235"}
{"text":"It has everything I would need for a home computer.","id":"2825"}
{"text":"The computer did what it was NOT supposed to do, and I didn't know what to do....","id":"514"}
{"text":"-Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic\/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.","id":"1048"}
{"text":"I love this computer.","id":"1729"}
{"text":"\u00a0 They informed me that I had around 7 \"policies\" or viruses on it.","id":"1904"}
{"text":"They don t translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.","id":"1182"}
{"text":"The acer one computer that I bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it, but I like the big screen on it.","id":"2455"}
{"text":"Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.","id":"1213"}
{"text":"i cant believe HP put this out.","id":"1394"}
{"text":"In\u00a0November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.","id":"1924"}
{"text":"without a big ol' clunky machine in my backpack, I feel like I can do programming homework anywhere.","id":"2268"}
{"text":"I can have both OSX and Windows XP running at the same time!","id":"2171"}
{"text":"I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.","id":"790"}
{"text":"Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor","id":"552"}
{"text":"Otherwise, I love it!","id":"1859"}
{"text":"Having someone give you a quick tour of how to's is the best.","id":"2589"}
{"text":"I have recently converted back to a mac and I couldn't be happier!","id":"2643"}
{"text":"Microsoft seems to be unable to keep up with repairs for the multitude of windows problems.","id":"733"}
{"text":"At 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes.","id":"870"}
{"text":"\u00a0 They basically told me that the machine would be problem free now.","id":"1910"}
{"text":"I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.","id":"2029"}
{"text":"The graphics are stunning.","id":"2242"}
{"text":"(I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.","id":"2085"}
{"text":"after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.","id":"543"}
{"text":"You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it.","id":"925"}
{"text":"It has been plagued with problems since the day i turned it on.","id":"724"}
{"text":"this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny.","id":"2139"}
{"text":"It is easy to navigate and update programs.","id":"1771"}
{"text":"The laptop is gorgeous.","id":"383"}
{"text":"It's more expensive but well worth it in the long run.","id":"2355"}
{"text":"I'm making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the 'old' way - and Apple does, indeed, have the better idea.","id":"2200"}
{"text":"I've had hp desktop for over 4 yrs now and not one days goes by that i don't regret buying it.","id":"723"}
{"text":"HP didn't fix it.","id":"2043"}
{"text":", Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications).","id":"2258"}
{"text":"All in all, a very disappointing experience except that I learned how good the Geek Squad is and also Customer Service.","id":"1960"}
{"text":"Now, I guess, I'll have to unload my M6809 on some poor, hapless soul.","id":"2006"}
{"text":"The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.","id":"2223"}
{"text":"The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.","id":"23"}
{"text":"Seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications (ie Internet tabs, programs, etc) simultaneously.","id":"2711"}
{"text":"\u00a0 The problems started with just the screen freezing.","id":"1899"}
{"text":"Taking it anywhere was a pain!","id":"495"}
{"text":"I also did not like the loud noises it made or how the bottom of the computer would get really hot.","id":"1606"}
{"text":"I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.","id":"1018"}
{"text":"I previously owned a Toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years.","id":"1761"}
{"text":"I can't imagine my life without it anymore!","id":"554"}
{"text":"defective software.","id":"2728"}
{"text":"This computer was so challenging to carry and handle.","id":"1964"}
{"text":"Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones\/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.","id":"2808"}
{"text":"Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.","id":"775"}
{"text":"It is much faster than my desktop which is a Core2 Quad running at 2.83 GHz.","id":"2424"}
{"text":"It is good to know that I can mobilize without having to worry about the battery life.","id":"1689"}
{"text":"I baby my electronics so I know for a fact it was defective and not anything that I did to it.","id":"1894"}
{"text":"The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.","id":"1078"}
{"text":"The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.","id":"1492"}
{"text":"3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.","id":"808"}
{"text":"Not to mention sometimes the whole charger unit will decide not to work entirely.","id":"1472"}
{"text":"Looks nice, but has a horribly cheap feel.","id":"1038"}
{"text":"I would recommend not buying this product.","id":"818"}
{"text":"its more like a snail crawl.","id":"861"}

{"text":"\u00a0 even though I had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty.","id":"1845"}
{"text":"I sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it.","id":"434"}
{"text":"It is a much more streamlined system for adding programs, using the internet, and doing other things everyone does on a computer.","id":"2479"}
{"text":"My computer froze on several occasion, had buttons that randomely would fall off and even had moments when the computer would refuse to turn on at all.","id":"1407"}

{"text":"Which was way too much money.","id":"1976"}
{"text":"To those thinking about switching, do it and do not look back!","id":"1643"}

{"text":"Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.","id":"1131"}
{"text":"One year of trying to fix the computer by myself, with help of friends, and even help from computer experts I have given up on trying to fix it.","id":"2052"}

{"text":"It is a REAL touchpad, not the toy I saw in other brands.","id":"2332"}
{"text":"It has worked fine.","id":"2687"}
{"text":"The most amazing part to me as a PC user is the startup and shutdown times - and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing.","id":"2633"}
{"text":"Long story, but after many calls to various  offices, I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers  don't take phone calls or e\/mails.","id":"845"}

{"text":"Price and purpose is awesome!","id":"2914"}
{"text":"Wonderful zooming.","id":"2318"}
{"text":"The screen is huge and coloful, but no LED backlighting.","id":"153"}
{"text":"the two of us use it regularly.","id":"3071"}
{"text":"In all honesty, if someone is looking for a quality laptop and willing to pay a little more money for a normal sized laptop than a cheaper and less impressive laptop, then do not buy this computer.","id":"1415"}
{"text":"Everything about this computer is easy to use.","id":"2946"}
{"text":"\u00a0 After paying over $1000 for this computer, it was not worth it.","id":"1380"}

{"text":"Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!","id":"2285"}
{"text":"My wife recently purchased an Apple MacBook Pro and our granddaughter fell in love with it and asked for one for her birthday.","id":"2148"}

{"text":"Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.","id":"2595"}
{"text":"I will only buy apple laptops from now on.","id":"584"}
{"text":"I would definitely suggest this laptop!","id":"2244"}
{"text":"It did not have all the features I expected it to have.","id":"1966"}
{"text":"Just a bunch of idiots who's English as a 5th language is forced at best.","id":"991"}
{"text":"No luck, although I waited for hours on the phone-Visited MacHouse, they stated the their call center is down due to too many phonecalls (difficult to believe).","id":"617"}
{"text":"There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark.","id":"2168"}
{"text":"It has a lot of memory and a great battery life.","id":"1765"}
{"text":"I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!","id":"778"}
{"text":"They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.","id":"1215"}
{"text":"5) Cut my losses and sold it for parts","id":"195"}
{"text":"All I can say is W-O-W.","id":"1"}

{"text":"Which is what I did, check out my ACER 5517!","id":"530"}
{"text":"He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.","id":"2553"}
{"text":"This purchase opened me to the world of Macbooks, and I am impressed with the intuition of the design, the beauty of the product, and the excellent technological advances associated with it.","id":"1485"}
{"text":"I have loved this since i took it out of the box.","id":"666"}
{"text":"The price is great for this model, I only plan on using it for media in the entertainment room.","id":"2672"}
{"text":"It seemed to be a very nice laptop except I was not able to load my Garmin GPS software or Microsoft Office 2003.","id":"1258"}
{"text":"But, like I said before, the only reason I don't currently have a Mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey.","id":"375"}
{"text":"I've also had to have the keyboard replaced at my expense.","id":"63"}
{"text":"I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a \"different\" computer.","id":"3048"}
{"text":"Was very much worth the price i paid.","id":"1552"}
{"text":"So far, so good.","id":"2598"}
{"text":"Even out of warranty!","id":"2112"}
{"text":"A tip for people looking into this computer: DO NOT BUY IT save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last.","id":"461"}
{"text":"This is a great little computer for the price.","id":"2823"}
{"text":"This comes in very handy for me as an educator.","id":"2249"}
{"text":"Crisp screen, great battery life, and plenty of storage.","id":"1582"}
{"text":"\u00a0 It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.","id":"1141"}
{"text":"All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.","id":"2140"}
{"text":"I was waiting for this model to be released since January, and have been holding off on buying a Macbook Pro until the new model came out.","id":"1786"}
{"text":"I will never buy another HP computer.","id":"2023"}
{"text":"So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer","id":"351"}
{"text":"You will regret it if you buy any dell.","id":"1389"}
{"text":"i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go.","id":"2545"}
{"text":"Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.","id":"908"}
{"text":"It started out getting hot after only a few months.","id":"867"}
{"text":"The Toshiba Satellite has been more than I expected for the price.","id":"2898"}
{"text":"I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.","id":"29"}
{"text":"I wish iWork or MS Office came with the Mac, but MS Office doesn't even come with most pc laptops.","id":"2561"}
{"text":"To my mind much more usable than the toy called an IPad.","id":"2376"}
{"text":"It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more.","id":"1560"}
{"text":"The best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once, it never slows down.","id":"2461"}
{"text":"Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.","id":"1039"}
{"text":", which Apple doesn't offer, is why I bought my MacBook at Best Buy.","id":"1519"}
{"text":"previous laptops were pc's, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.","id":"2380"}
{"text":"The computer is a dream come true.","id":"2172"}
{"text":"i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have.","id":"349"}
{"text":"I'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC.","id":"2255"}
{"text":"Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened.","id":"1309"}
{"text":"You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.","id":"2299"}
{"text":"I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.","id":"712"}
{"text":"I took it to the shop and they said It would cost too much to repair it.","id":"872"}
{"text":"Didn't expect to repair it at once!","id":"1109"}
{"text":"It is quiet and a real joy to watch work.","id":"389"}
{"text":"With notes saying they replaced the hard drive.","id":"506"}
{"text":"The laptop is relatively simple to use, though I bought  Macs for Dummies,  which is well worth $2","id":"1175"}
{"text":"Can't close the 2nd HDD bay since there are brackets you have to break off (even then, it still doesn't shut) That could be a major flaw for the dual HDD user.","id":"1049"}
{"text":"From the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.","id":"233"}
{"text":"No tutorials on the display.","id":"265"}
{"text":"The leather carrying case, keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from Memphis warehouse.","id":"394"}
{"text":"The touch pad is among the best.","id":"152"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed!","id":"143"}
{"text":"If you are a person like me, more on the creative side, the mac has something for you too.","id":"1656"}
{"text":"I had to have these computers in my school.","id":"1402"}
{"text":"Thus, when you carry it at a slanted angle, the screen will \"topple\" or \"slide\" down, if you understand what I mean.","id":"1284"}
{"text":"Again.","id":"1317"}
{"text":"To this day, there are NONE.","id":"1636"}
{"text":"i setup my password last night with the password on my other computer.","id":"409"}
{"text":"it is an amazing image and it too is holding up quite nicely to little hands grabbing the back of my laptop.","id":"2131"}
{"text":"first i have been searching for long time before i decided to get mac.","id":"2228"}
{"text":"It's now all commodity hardware.","id":"1797"}
{"text":"We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows Server Enterprise 2003, and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise.","id":"2272"}
{"text":"I was so excited when my dad said i could get a new laptop for my birthday.","id":"479"}
{"text":"We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired.","id":"2657"}
{"text":"-They reported that the computer is in their headquarters.","id":"618"}
{"text":"bought notebook 07\/2009.","id":"1207"}
{"text":"How Toshiba handles the repair seems to vary, some folks  indicate that they were charged for even an intial fix, others had the  repair done 5 times.","id":"848"}
{"text":"I would like to use a different operating system altogether.","id":"734"}
{"text":"All of them were Windows machines.","id":"230"}
{"text":"Well, I had completed the presentation in powerpoint the night before on my PC, but took the Apple to the conference.","id":"2194"}
{"text":"The latest and mightiest Macbook pro 17-inch was bought by my university on the 30th of June 2009.","id":"611"}
{"text":"I have a business website and every time I have to change something I have to go to the public library to use a PC.","id":"1195"}
{"text":"I paid about the same for my Toshiba as I did for the compaq a few years back.","id":"2893"}
{"text":"This was an update from an early MacBook Pro.","id":"1712"}
{"text":"I think I might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion.","id":"2982"}
{"text":"But the staff was so horrible to us.","id":"3121"}
{"text":"To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.","id":"2777"}
{"text":"The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.","id":"1634"}
{"text":"Where Gabriela personaly greets you and recommends you what to eat.","id":"2534"}
{"text":"For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.","id":"583"}
{"text":"Not only was the food outstanding, but the little 'perks' were great.","id":"2846"}
{"text":"It is very overpriced and not very tasty.","id":"1571"}
{"text":"Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).","id":"1458"}
{"text":"The Bagels have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture, both chewy yet not gummy.","id":"3161"}
{"text":"Nevertheless the food itself is pretty good.","id":"2391"}
{"text":"i've noticed megadeth, mr. scruff, st. germain, traditional vietnamese songs, black sabbath, jay-z, and daft punk all being played.","id":"986"}
{"text":"They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.","id":"296"}
{"text":"It took half an hour to get our check, which was perfect since we could sit, have drinks and talk!","id":"1793"}
{"text":"The design and atmosphere is just as good.","id":"2200"}
{"text":"He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.","id":"3195"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend Mary's and am making it one of my regular neighborhood haunts.","id":"3119"}
{"text":"The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.","id":"3359"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!","id":"70"}
{"text":"He can't help, they're bought up so fast.","id":"1829"}
{"text":"Secondly, on this night the place was overwhelmed by upper east side ladies perfume.","id":"2935"}
{"text":"i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.","id":"1805"}
{"text":"Obviously run by folks who know a pie.","id":"2559"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed.","id":"716"}
{"text":"IT IS DEFINITELY SPECIAL AND AFFORDABLE.","id":"2464"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.","id":"385"}
{"text":"I will be going back very soon.","id":"1350"}
{"text":"All the money went into the interior decoration, none of it went to the chefs.","id":"3534"}
{"text":"The seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches.","id":"1407"}
{"text":"I asked for seltzer with lime, no ice.","id":"565"}
{"text":"It was pretty inexpensive too.","id":"387"}
{"text":"Will not be back.","id":"1314"}
{"text":"Don't go alone---even two people isn't enough for the whole experience, with pickles and a selection of meats and seafoods.","id":"675"}
{"text":"My suggestion is to eat family style because you'll want to try the other dishes.","id":"2227"}
{"text":"Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.","id":"3367"}
{"text":"This isn't a value joint.","id":"1210"}
{"text":"Faan's got a great concept but a little rough on the delivery.","id":"2191"}
{"text":"From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.","id":"270"}
{"text":"Great food at REASONABLE prices, makes for an evening that can't be beat!","id":"638"}
{"text":"Look foward to trying the Ruben upon returning.","id":"500"}
{"text":"The only other steakhouse that seems to hold a candle to Roth's is the Strip House.","id":"1108"}
{"text":"We usually go to the Chart House to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.","id":"3294"}
{"text":"this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.","id":"388"}
{"text":"You'll adore it.","id":"3070"}
{"text":"Two words: Free wine.","id":"3373"}
{"text":"The price is reasonable although the service is poor.","id":"425"}
{"text":"The quantity is also very good, you will come out satisfied.","id":"3192"}
{"text":"I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.","id":"1098"}
{"text":"Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.","id":"2173"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.","id":"391"}
{"text":"Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant.","id":"263"}
{"text":"The fried rice is amazing here.","id":"2384"}
{"text":"Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.","id":"2962"}
{"text":"it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.","id":"3404"}
{"text":"The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.","id":"2599"}
{"text":"At the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup.","id":"673"}
{"text":"I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.","id":"648"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.","id":"863"}
{"text":"The wine list is excellent.","id":"1623"}
{"text":"so garantuan that you can't fit them in a toaster.","id":"2177"}
{"text":"Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).","id":"430"}
{"text":"They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.","id":"1101"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Sophia pizza.","id":"1823"}
{"text":"Whem asked, we had to ask more detailed questions so that we knew what the specials were.","id":"324"}
{"text":"This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.","id":"2783"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.","id":"2983"}
{"text":"All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!","id":"66"}
{"text":"After really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner.","id":"627"}
{"text":"Fabulous service, fantastic food, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment.","id":"3219"}
{"text":"Not what I wanted to hear.","id":"2934"}
{"text":"Try the lasagnette appetizer.","id":"2787"}
{"text":"Pricey, but worth a try, at least once.","id":"825"}
{"text":"I've been there a few times, and I usually end up sitting next to some pretty odd people.","id":"197"}
{"text":"I liked the beer selection!","id":"604"}
{"text":"Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting.","id":"2911"}
{"text":"Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.","id":"3074"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back.","id":"1479"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds.","id":"1074"}
{"text":"Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.","id":"912"}
{"text":"With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .","id":"728"}
{"text":"The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.","id":"2925"}
{"text":"If you are a carnivore, come hungry and you will leave more satisfied than you have ever been.","id":"495"}
{"text":"The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.","id":"3436"}
{"text":"Not too crazy about their sake martini.","id":"3273"}
{"text":"Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.","id":"1215"}
{"text":"The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.","id":"183"}
{"text":"whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.","id":"2511"}
{"text":"One thing I liked about this place is that I never felt rushed or pressured to give up my table ot incoming guests.","id":"282"}
{"text":"This place is a great bargain.","id":"1562"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place purely by accident and were pleased with the results.","id":"1712"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food is outstanding, but everything else about this restaurant is the pits.","id":"3249"}
{"text":"Deff recimmend Bukhara they also have opened two new locations guess ill try them out.","id":"2052"}
{"text":"We always have a delicious meal and always leave feeling satisfied.","id":"3207"}
{"text":"Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat.","id":"672"}
{"text":"First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.","id":"2972"}
{"text":"My husbands was perfect, my was well done and dry.","id":"1903"}
{"text":"Everyone I have spoken too there is super friendly, helpful, and willing to the extra mile for a customer.","id":"2549"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good and huge.","id":"1755"}
{"text":"Sapphire is the only Indian restaurant I go to when I'm in NYC.","id":"2890"}
{"text":"The cuisine from what I've gathered is authentic Taiwanese, though its very different from what I've been accustomed to in Taipei.","id":"2277"}
{"text":"I heartily recommend.","id":"2308"}
{"text":"Heartland Brewery is by far one of the best places in NYC to make new friends and catch up with old ones.","id":"51"}
{"text":"I almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and I would hate for it too become to crowded.","id":"3680"}
{"text":"They are often crowded on the weekends but they are efficient and accurate with their service.","id":"3155"}
{"text":"All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.","id":"1688"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.","id":"598"}
{"text":"We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.","id":"2926"}
{"text":"The wait staff is friendly, and the food has gotten better and better!","id":"3083"}
{"text":"This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!","id":"1388"}
{"text":"It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.","id":"2977"}
{"text":"This place is so much fun.","id":"1574"}
{"text":"I was glad I did.","id":"498"}
{"text":"Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.","id":"2604"}
{"text":"I've never been treated so rudely.","id":"473"}
{"text":"I'll be back soon.","id":"380"}
{"text":"Le Pere Pinard has a $15 pre-theater menu that is outstanding.","id":"2960"}
{"text":"Went inside and I started to get excited.","id":"322"}
{"text":"I also ordered for delivery and the restaurant forgot half the order.","id":"1383"}
{"text":"Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.","id":"892"}

{"text":"but overall i give it a 10","id":"2061"}
{"text":"Though the Spider Roll may look like a challenge to eat, with soft shell crab hanging out of the roll, it is well worth the price you pay for them.","id":"2274"}
{"text":"Deep Fried Skewers are good and still rare to find in NYC.","id":"2804"}
{"text":"I have tried to make reservations, but both times, the hostess didn't have my name.","id":"194"}
{"text":"I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).","id":"148"}
{"text":"Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.","id":"2747"}
{"text":"This was one of the BEST restaurants I've ever been to.","id":"2845"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be pretty decent.","id":"187"}
{"text":"An oasis of refinement:  Food, though somewhat uneven, often reaches the pinnacles of new American fine cuisine - chef's passion (and kitchen's precise execution) is most evident in the fish dishes and soups.","id":"856"}
{"text":"If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!","id":"2033"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.","id":"1402"}

{"text":"It was tiny and I felt like I was eating in someone's living room.","id":"2949"}
{"text":"I was there on sat.","id":"570"}
{"text":"Overall A oh ya even though there is waiting it is deff worth it","id":"2053"}
{"text":"The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.","id":"3316"}

{"text":"From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.","id":"738"}
{"text":"Lahore is a great place to duck into late-night when you need some really tasty food on the cheap -- you'll likely have trouble finishing the amount of food you get for FOUR DOLLARS.","id":"1549"}

{"text":"good selection of wines ranging from affordable to high end.","id":"2941"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant overall, with classic upscale Italian decor.","id":"362"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food.","id":"2921"}
{"text":"The entire dining experience was wonderful!","id":"1909"}
{"text":"The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.","id":"1878"}

{"text":"Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.","id":"173"}
{"text":"Other than the crappy service from two individuals, it's great.","id":"1836"}
{"text":"What more can you ask for?","id":"1703"}
{"text":"Wondering who had the best deals we noticed a line had formed to wait for this one particular establishment.","id":"3564"}
{"text":"They have authentic Indian at amazin prices.","id":"1404"}
{"text":"You are treated just like royality.","id":"645"}

{"text":"I've never felt more unwelcome than last month at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.","id":"1144"}
{"text":"Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.","id":"2639"}
{"text":"Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.","id":"1474"}
{"text":"Looking from the outside in, one would hesitate to enter this hole in the wall (really, that's what it is).","id":"1553"}
{"text":"and yes Dal Bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs.","id":"2059"}
{"text":"I look forward to eating here again","id":"926"}

{"text":"A glass of Leaping Lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy.","id":"2469"}
{"text":"Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.","id":"567"}
{"text":"The food always tastes fresh and served promptly.","id":"3517"}
{"text":"I know because I live nearby.","id":"2069"}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious.","id":"1599"}
{"text":"My entire family was horrified.","id":"2860"}
{"text":"On a monthly basis my friends and I get together and have a girls night out.","id":"1092"}

{"text":"For great chinese food nearby, you have Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan just a block away.","id":"759"}
{"text":"But who says Murray's is anything about service.","id":"3175"}
{"text":"This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.","id":"2209"}
{"text":"I have NEVER been disappointed in the Red Eye.","id":"2717"}
{"text":"Hats off to the chef.","id":"1352"}
{"text":"This should have been done in a back room - away from customers.","id":"1543"}
{"text":"Service could be improved but overall this is a place that understands the importance of little things (the heavy, black, antique-seeming teapot, for one) in the restaurant experience.","id":"3537"}
{"text":"Glad you have the luxury to throw out paying customers.","id":"3213"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.","id":"1743"}
{"text":"Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York.","id":"1321"}
{"text":"service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.","id":"2907"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was crowded but it was a great bistro-type vibe.","id":"1890"}
{"text":"Check it out","id":"2675"}
{"text":"First off, the waitress was completely unattentive the 2 times we saw her(odd in a restaurant with 6 tables) and got our order wrong.","id":"2588"}
{"text":"Don't go.","id":"2234"}
{"text":"The food was bland oily.","id":"3130"}
{"text":"But they do.","id":"3285"}
{"text":"What is even better, is that the prices are very affordable as well, and the food is really good.","id":"709"}
{"text":"The fish is fresh but the variety of fish is nothing out of ordinary.","id":"1198"}
{"text":"Look I dont know if the people who wrote the reviews have ever been to a decent place (PLEASE TRY SOMEOTHER PLACES).","id":"2380"}
{"text":"Suan has challenged this loyalty.","id":"2250"}
{"text":"Our favorite meal is a pesto pizza, the house salad, and a good bottle of wine.","id":"2302"}
{"text":"And Kruno, the beverage manager is the best bartender I have yet to come across.","id":"1110"}
{"text":"Ambiance and music funky, which I enjoy.","id":"973"}
{"text":"The food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.","id":"2132"}
{"text":"I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.","id":"231"}
{"text":"It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.","id":"1184"}
{"text":"I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.","id":"250"}
{"text":"Went with mommy (the only person who could afford taking me here).","id":"227"}
{"text":"My friends and I were on vacation in NY and was referred to Chance by a friend.","id":"3653"}
{"text":"Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.","id":"2988"}
{"text":"Try the tandoori salmon!","id":"3092"}
{"text":"I am completely hooked on this place, it is ridiculous.","id":"1166"}
{"text":"Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.","id":"3686"}
{"text":"Granted the space is smaller than most, it is the best service you will find in even the largest of restaurants.","id":"1922"}
{"text":"Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.","id":"2978"}
{"text":"We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.","id":"2139"}
{"text":"I love the atmorphere @ peep!","id":"2454"}
{"text":"Enjoy!","id":"1881"}
{"text":"We weren't!","id":"633"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed.","id":"268"}
{"text":"(La Rosa is connected by a swinging door to the Mexican restaurant Pacifico).","id":"3613"}
{"text":"It could have been handled better.","id":"1531"}
{"text":"The service was attentive and her suggestions of menu items was right on the mark.","id":"603"}
{"text":"The other night we had the $30 three course meal and everything was delicious - if I could of licked the plate clean I would of.","id":"678"}
{"text":"Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!","id":"2690"}
{"text":"Even after getting pushed out by the no-class Famous Ray's, Sal has risen again to carry on his father's uncle's legacies with a smile, true love for his community, and let's not forget the Outstanding Pizza!","id":"1830"}
{"text":"It's a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early.","id":"1408"}
{"text":"The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.","id":"2521"}
{"text":"We had crawfish boiled and despite making a mess, it was a ton of fun and quite tasty as well.","id":"1918"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place and made a reservation a couple of months in advance for a special occasion.","id":"2930"}
{"text":"They were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior.","id":"2166"}
{"text":"What came to our table was burned beyond recognition and stringy.","id":"887"}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai and the noodles were sticky.","id":"2448"}
{"text":"So I've never actually been to M proper, but I've had it delivered a few times.","id":"3244"}
{"text":"Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.","id":"1478"}
{"text":"Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.","id":"1413"}
{"text":"The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.","id":"3129"}
{"text":"If you're craving for Haru's great food, especially the House Roll, but can't stand the wait building outisde, head across the street to their Sake Bar!","id":"2271"}
{"text":"A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.","id":"1554"}
{"text":"The food is great.","id":"2306"}
{"text":"Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.","id":"1975"}
{"text":"Lunch came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.","id":"3699"}
{"text":"Decent wine at reasonable prices.","id":"2875"}
{"text":"All conveniently delivered right to the door.","id":"2303"}
{"text":"even the wine by the glass was good.","id":"2513"}
{"text":"Nice Family owned traditional restaurant.","id":"458"}
{"text":"would have rather tried terrace in the sky or water club for that price","id":"809"}
{"text":"This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.","id":"141"}
{"text":"I also ordered the Change Mojito, which was out of this world.","id":"3655"}
{"text":"Okay service.","id":"2098"}
{"text":"The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.","id":"1624"}
{"text":"We were very pleasantly surprised.","id":"1928"}
{"text":"The food was just awful, ATROCIOUS actually.","id":"2377"}
{"text":"I will never visit this restaurant again.","id":"3209"}
{"text":"The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.","id":"338"}
{"text":"The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.","id":"1630"}
{"text":"The waitress suggested glasses of wine that went very well with the food.","id":"1907"}
{"text":"(or sister, in my case!).","id":"1557"}
{"text":"I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.","id":"3408"}
{"text":"They might be all business at the counter when you give your order, but their food says I love you.","id":"1535"}
{"text":"We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.","id":"3202"}
{"text":"Try their plain pizza with fresh garlic or eggplant.","id":"449"}
{"text":"Don't go there!","id":"1449"}
{"text":"Ok, so the servers wander around a little clueless, but there's more than enough servers for the crowd they get -- it's fine, you just have to make a small effort to get their attention.","id":"927"}
{"text":"Good luck getting a table.","id":"585"}
{"text":"We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.","id":"1927"}
{"text":"Don't look down your nose at me like that...","id":"1367"}
{"text":"Planet Thai is great!","id":"701"}
{"text":"The service is awful.","id":"345"}
{"text":"Just don't do it.","id":"293"}
{"text":"Just ignore the trendy wannabes.","id":"1720"}
{"text":"The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!","id":"1494"}
{"text":"Trust me, it will be great, and all of it will be devoured in no time.","id":"1085"}
{"text":"My girlfiends and I ate at O.G. again last night.","id":"2636"}
{"text":"I wish they had one near my office- I would go everyday.","id":"1179"}
{"text":"Finally!","id":"1976"}
{"text":"Amma has the worst value for money I have experienced in NYC over the past 2 years.","id":"1315"}
{"text":"I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.","id":"3194"}
{"text":"I think this would be a pretty good spot if it were not so overpriced and overrated.","id":"688"}
{"text":"Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes.","id":"2393"}
{"text":"The pizza is good though.","id":"1278"}
{"text":"bottles of wine are cheap and good.","id":"2201"}
{"text":"You will not be disapointed at all.","id":"624"}
{"text":"Walk-ins are risky too.","id":"3252"}
{"text":"The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.","id":"620"}
{"text":"They didn't give us the dinner special until we asked for it.","id":"3541"}
{"text":"You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.","id":"865"}
{"text":"word of advice, save room for pasta dishes and never leave until you've had the tiramisu.","id":"375"}
{"text":"Very good service and very good prices.","id":"2126"}
{"text":"I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.","id":"2078"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.","id":"846"}
{"text":"Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.","id":"2158"}
{"text":"Our food was great too!","id":"1578"}
{"text":"Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)","id":"1282"}
{"text":"The most annoying thing, though, is the fact that the servers seem to be trained to drive revenue.","id":"1319"}
{"text":"Get your food to go, find a bench, and kick back with a plate of dumplings.","id":"1175"}
{"text":"Please try the Filet Mignon, its just the most tender piece ever.","id":"1115"}
{"text":"Everything we had was pretty good, but we have only been there once.","id":"3396"}
{"text":"We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.","id":"34"}
{"text":"Something about them being busy with holiday party's.","id":"798"}
{"text":"The sake menu should not be overlooked!","id":"395"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend.","id":"1838"}
{"text":"This place is great.","id":"176"}
{"text":"the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm.","id":"3102"}
{"text":"i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good.","id":"984"}
{"text":"With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!","id":"2138"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.","id":"1472"}
{"text":"The service, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.","id":"1969"}
{"text":"Went there last night for 2 year anniversery, and wasn't all that impressed.","id":"1674"}
{"text":"It was rather pathetic that it took them over an hour to seat us.","id":"1330"}
{"text":"We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow.","id":"763"}
{"text":"At first I was slightly skeptical because it was a sushi restaurant in the middle of NYC.","id":"332"}
{"text":"It's really also the service, is good and the waiters are friendly.","id":"754"}
{"text":"Suan was a recommendation that I am glad we heeded.","id":"2248"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.","id":"691"}
{"text":"We visit at least once a month.","id":"3363"}
{"text":"It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.","id":"999"}
{"text":"Also, the place is popular with families, so if you're bothered by children running loose like wild animals, come later at night to avoid them.","id":"2503"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short.","id":"1310"}
{"text":"I felt as though I were eating in Paris.","id":"940"}
{"text":"Lived in Shanghai most of my life and thought the food was comparable to the flagship Green Bo restaurant there.","id":"247"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.","id":"2823"}
{"text":"However, it's not worth a special trip.","id":"3628"}
{"text":"Nice value.","id":"349"}
{"text":"Gigino's in Wagner Park is so enjoyable.","id":"987"}
{"text":"And it was quick which is very important.","id":"1611"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.","id":"2649"}
{"text":"All the NYU students love this place so it makes for a fun young atmosphere.","id":"2396"}
{"text":"The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).","id":"139"}
{"text":"But, nothing stands out about the cooking.","id":"841"}
{"text":"Joya used to be a cool spot with decent food and a colorful - if not relaxed - atmosphere.","id":"3477"}
{"text":"If that's a problem, go to McDonald's and destroy your insides.","id":"442"}
{"text":"The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).","id":"90"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times for lunch and it is one of my favorites in the city.","id":"298"}
{"text":"I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.","id":"1104"}
{"text":"I work near-by, and they have the BEST oatmeal in the neighborhood- not a packaged or quick-cooked item.","id":"2563"}
{"text":"Always busy but fast moving.","id":"1280"}
{"text":"Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.","id":"2790"}
{"text":"The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.","id":"323"}
{"text":"Sexy.","id":"24"}
{"text":"The food was really good, I had the onion soup and it was one of the best ever.","id":"1891"}
{"text":"I will have to say, this Bengali Fast Food joint is clearly my favorite.","id":"2417"}
{"text":"I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.","id":"2980"}
{"text":"overall, a solid restaurant and at less than $40pp (including wine), a solid deal as well.","id":"3451"}
{"text":"Since it literally is a complete hole in the wall, it's a bit intimidating at first, but you get over that very quickly as soon as the friendly staff welcomes you - don't hesitate to ask for help with what to get.","id":"1551"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews for dinner, this is a place I would reconsider revisiting for that, but definitely not for Dim Sum again.","id":"3146"}
{"text":"It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.","id":"1785"}
{"text":"Even with John's and Joe's around the corner, this place will make a name for itself.","id":"1492"}
{"text":"It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.","id":"406"}
{"text":"When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.","id":"3650"}
{"text":"My girlfriend convinced me to go in the other night for a quick bite.","id":"2985"}
{"text":"The dim sum is ok but doesn't taste that fresh, and the little dishes don't look steamy hot as they should (also note lack of Chinese here).","id":"2084"}
{"text":"despite the untasteful previous review...","id":"2536"}
{"text":"Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.","id":"1820"}
{"text":"Sure, everyone's got their favorite, but to know Sal, is to know New York.","id":"1826"}
{"text":"I think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation.","id":"96"}
{"text":"Also they were $15 each!","id":"3584"}
{"text":"The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.","id":"3193"}
{"text":"My friends spoke so much about it for months, I finally made the time to come down ear and dine in.","id":"93"}
{"text":"If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.","id":"2212"}
{"text":"I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.","id":"3426"}
{"text":"The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.","id":"1138"}
{"text":"This is as good as neighborhood restaurants come.","id":"1461"}
{"text":"If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!","id":"128"}
{"text":"You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.","id":"1008"}
{"text":"One of the more authentic Shanghainese restaurants in the US definitely the best in Manhattan Chinatown.","id":"241"}
{"text":"We will go back every time we are in the City.","id":"1581"}
{"text":"we love th pink pony.","id":"1815"}
{"text":"So eat fast and order a lot.","id":"1746"}
{"text":"Staff is very accomodating.","id":"2124"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer.","id":"2919"}
{"text":"--Eat Club is a roving group of NYC gluttons","id":"2360"}
{"text":"If you were there when it first opened, give this restaurant a second chance.","id":"3082"}
{"text":"I went to Del Frisco's Friday night with my boyfriend for an 8:00 reservation.","id":"1950"}
{"text":"If you like Sakagura but you feel it's too much, you'd better try Yokocho.","id":"2803"}
{"text":"yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me.","id":"1133"}
{"text":"Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.","id":"3204"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place.","id":"1728"}
{"text":"Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ).","id":"2801"}
{"text":"Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.","id":"2140"}
{"text":"Not pretentious and very economical.","id":"2447"}
{"text":"The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing.","id":"224"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.","id":"2434"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.","id":"459"}
{"text":"We have never had any problems with charging the meal or the tip, and the food was delivered quickly, but we live only a few minutes walk from them.","id":"3042"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service.","id":"152"}
{"text":"Authentic bistro!","id":"3062"}
{"text":"They are tasty, but I suggest only eating one with meat because they tend not to mesh that well with the average American digestive system.","id":"2426"}
{"text":"Somewhat pricey but what the heck.","id":"225"}
{"text":"It's true, this place is not cheap.","id":"2424"}
{"text":"Try the hot dogs too, they're snappy and delicious.","id":"494"}
{"text":"Delivery is fast too.","id":"1033"}
{"text":"Being from the south, there aren't any good delis in my area and while watching Foods across America on PBS I found out about Katz's Deli.","id":"496"}
{"text":"The noise level was unbearable, conversation impossible.","id":"2486"}
{"text":"Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.","id":"2307"}
{"text":"Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.","id":"1646"}
{"text":"One of the earlier people commenting on the restaurant did not get the that some experimenting is going on with the menu in a positive way.","id":"3255"}
{"text":"It's convenient.","id":"2229"}
{"text":"Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.","id":"2615"}

{"text":"I wouldn't even have complained at all if the food at least tasted good but the quality of food was crappy, too.","id":"1689"}
{"text":"For the next hour and a half we stood in the crowded lobby area of this touristy restaurant listening to all types of explanations of why we were not being seated.","id":"771"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.","id":"3370"}
{"text":"Also good for client lunch meetings, esp.","id":"823"}

{"text":"We didn't even see a menu, as our waiter described both the specials and the main dishes.","id":"1616"}
{"text":"The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.","id":"3189"}
{"text":"otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.","id":"3693"}
{"text":"The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.","id":"1103"}

{"text":"I love and I know gourmet food by excellence!","id":"1994"}
{"text":"I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....","id":"541"}
{"text":"Great people watching as others do the same to you.","id":"229"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just an unintentional mistake but I've experienced the same with other restaurants so I don't appreciate such practice.","id":"3542"}
{"text":"Two people in our party felt like something else, and Volare immediately obliged with two great dishes that were not in their regular menu.","id":"1617"}
{"text":"He offers subpar service and has no personality.","id":"3322"}
{"text":"The waitress remembers me and is very friendly, she knows what my regular is and that's the fried mini buns with the condensed milk and the assorted fruits on beancurd.","id":"1022"}
{"text":"I'm going back.","id":"751"}
{"text":"Diner food at bistro prices is a bummer....","id":"1711"}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going here regularly for two years.","id":"2179"}
{"text":"wow! how have i missed this one ,tried Long Tan last week for the first time and now know what the NY TIMES and many more in the neighborhood already knew.","id":"1131"}
{"text":"Go there on an empty stomach and leave feeling like a baby Veal Calf(ok bad joke), but you will see.","id":"2723"}
{"text":"While we thoroughly enjoyed the food, it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation.","id":"2012"}
{"text":"Me and my girls will definitely go back.","id":"1684"}
{"text":"The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.","id":"3024"}
{"text":"The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.","id":"1622"}

{"text":"All the food was hot tasty.","id":"3067"}
{"text":"Have been several times and it never dissapoints.","id":"530"}

{"text":"Our server was very helpful and friendly.","id":"1592"}
{"text":"Try green curry with vegetables.","id":"3191"}
{"text":"Would recommend this place as a good date spot if you don't want to drop a ton of cash.","id":"3433"}
{"text":"While I'm not sure that this happens all the time-this is the kind of treatment that buys repeat business!","id":"2134"}
{"text":"This place was not ALL THAT!","id":"2947"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.","id":"2770"}
{"text":"The second you walk through the heavy vault like door, with people anticipating your arrival you get the sense that you are going to have the dining ride of a lifetime.","id":"1989"}
{"text":"Much more reasonably priced too!","id":"445"}
{"text":"If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.","id":"653"}

{"text":"For $760 for 2 people, it's a once in a lifetime experience.","id":"2000"}
{"text":"The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.","id":"1316"}
{"text":"We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.","id":"2450"}
{"text":"I think the stuff was better than Disney.","id":"1577"}
{"text":"After reading the good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try with two friends.","id":"3538"}
{"text":"While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.","id":"2901"}
{"text":"Orsay, is without a doubt one of the best values for authentic French food in NYC.","id":"908"}
{"text":"I had been searching really hard for a restaurant in New York where I could really feel unwanted and ignored and I finally found it!","id":"1790"}
{"text":"It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.","id":"150"}
{"text":"Well, their deliveries take for ever and the food is usually cold.","id":"2523"}
{"text":"The staff is no nonsense.","id":"2170"}
{"text":"Chinese Desserts are known for healthful benefits in addition to the sweetness.","id":"1012"}
{"text":"Wonderful at holiday time.","id":"1626"}

{"text":"This place has many different styles of pizza and they are all amazing.","id":"3631"}
{"text":"The photos of the restaurant in its web site are way better than the real look.","id":"901"}
{"text":"The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.","id":"3049"}
{"text":"But the coconut rice was good.","id":"1242"}
{"text":"It took them 25 minutes to bring our appetizer.","id":"932"}
{"text":"A guaranteeed delight!","id":"2769"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this neighborhood spot for years.","id":"1105"}

{"text":"The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.","id":"2225"}
{"text":"The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).","id":"1056"}
{"text":"But, they were too big for the bun.","id":"3582"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.","id":"2708"}

{"text":"It takes forever to get a drink and they almost always forget to bring something (although they dont forget to charge you for it.","id":"3475"}

{"text":"Also very inexpensive.","id":"3461"}

{"text":"The food is great and reasonably priced.","id":"193"}
{"text":"The characters really make for an enjoyable experience.","id":"1569"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!","id":"2217"}
{"text":"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.","id":"78"}
{"text":"The restuarant itself is not large, but seems to have several round tables to accomodate large groups hoping to save a buck to eat authentic Taiwanese.","id":"2280"}
{"text":"My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.","id":"3424"}

{"text":"Unfortunately, the food was NOT something to get worked up about.","id":"1709"}
{"text":"It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).","id":"1550"}
{"text":"I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.","id":"3305"}

{"text":"I loving bringing friends here - and I do so every chance I get.","id":"2630"}
{"text":"- the bread at the beginning is super tasty and makes you want more - the pizza is delicious and comes in personal sizes, however be warned that the Peter's Favourite pizza with prosciutto and baby arugula is actually a margarite pizza with cold prosciutto and baby arugula on top, like a salad.","id":"3353"}
{"text":"Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it.","id":"2081"}
{"text":"The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.","id":"533"}

{"text":"I would go back tho.","id":"2673"}
{"text":"The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.","id":"2276"}

{"text":"They also do a great job for restaurant week.","id":"2716"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.","id":"746"}
{"text":"The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).","id":"2912"}
{"text":"This is where the aforementioned line was.","id":"3566"}
{"text":"The food is reliable and the price is moderate.","id":"1702"}
{"text":"Aside from the bearded, courdoroy blazer professor type with the NYU student he's sleeping with that week, you see a strange mix of hipsters, frat boys, Will Smith types who need to be told they are black, bitter cougars who cant understand why they arent married yet....","id":"199"}
{"text":"While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.","id":"882"}
{"text":"We always go there on the weekends and leave extremely full and satisfied.","id":"2324"}
{"text":"i dont how this place is still running.","id":"2524"}
{"text":"The server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile.","id":"628"}

{"text":"Planet Thailand has always been a hit with me , I go there usually for the sushi, which is great , the thai food is excellent too .","id":"727"}
{"text":"Very excited to hear that short-term Chef Jason Narone has moved on, he truly was a low point of their Sterling track record.","id":"1925"}
{"text":"Excellent experience.","id":"2740"}
{"text":"Well worth the trip, close to City Hall and downtown subway stops.","id":"3422"}
{"text":"I had to share my table with a loud group of kids and the service was rude an unattentive.","id":"3144"}
{"text":"What more could you want?","id":"2202"}
{"text":"If you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained, this is a great place to go and eat.","id":"618"}
{"text":"All in all, I don't see how you can go wrong.","id":"1919"}
{"text":"The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.","id":"1487"}

{"text":"My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.","id":"1868"}
{"text":"We were told that the wait was about twenty minutes and there would be no problem for our 8:00 pm curtain call.","id":"770"}

{"text":"Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!","id":"1940"}
{"text":"The prices were fantastic.","id":"2451"}
{"text":"What a great place!","id":"56"}
{"text":"Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...","id":"1632"}
{"text":"The table service could have been a little more attentive but as someone who also works in the service industry, I understood they were busy.","id":"1961"}
{"text":"It's not mind-blowing, but to me, thai food never is and never will be.","id":"710"}
{"text":"Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).","id":"911"}
{"text":"Although, one night we went it was super cheesy, and another night it was less cheesy.","id":"3607"}
{"text":"Even though it is a little loud, you don't have to yell at each other to talk.","id":"1955"}
{"text":"i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.","id":"2903"}
{"text":"It is kinda nosiy and the tables are close together but it's still a beautiful place to enjoy a nice dinner.","id":"1887"}
{"text":"Was surprisingly disappointed.","id":"3495"}
{"text":"I love the fact that the pizza tastes so good and is so cheap.","id":"1273"}
{"text":"Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.","id":"590"}

{"text":"The sushi was awful!","id":"339"}
{"text":"Katz's has been a NYC original for over 100 years.","id":"489"}
{"text":"You can get an excellent meal at most of the many Indian restaurants on nearby Lexington Avenue for the cost of one the dainty dishes here.","id":"2487"}
{"text":"The Pastrami sandwich was like buttah and with pickles and an icy cold beer to wash it down, it was a pleasurable experience.","id":"499"}
{"text":"The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.","id":"2589"}
{"text":"Late nite omelletes are not good here, there is no variety!","id":"3701"}
{"text":"Everything at Sala Thai is tasty and well-portioned.","id":"381"}
{"text":"After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.","id":"3050"}
{"text":"It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.","id":"1185"}
{"text":"Behind this counter, two men are squeezed in.","id":"1555"}
{"text":"Great find!!!","id":"1112"}
{"text":"If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!","id":"3368"}
{"text":"Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.","id":"1032"}

{"text":"Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.","id":"1663"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.","id":"1690"}
{"text":"The website and rating makes this place look wonderful but in reality it was very disappointing.","id":"788"}
{"text":"Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.","id":"1780"}
{"text":"The outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful.","id":"742"}
{"text":"A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.","id":"1471"}
{"text":"In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.","id":"1789"}
{"text":"I definitely wouldn't go back.","id":"2751"}
{"text":"It is not worth for that bucks.","id":"1189"}
{"text":"brick oven gallery is My pick for best pizza restaurant anywhere.","id":"3352"}
{"text":"Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.","id":"3315"}
{"text":"For many people, this may not seem like Aunthentic Thai food because most places in NYC arent quite authentic.","id":"3393"}
{"text":"Growing up in NY, I have eaten my share of bagels.","id":"2157"}
{"text":"Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!","id":"3018"}
{"text":"A hearty two thumbs up!","id":"1401"}
{"text":"The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.","id":"257"}
{"text":"All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!","id":"813"}
{"text":"Besides having the table we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated, we were served dishes we hadn't ordered three times, received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served (and that order was undercooked), and charged $45 more than we should have been on our bill.","id":"2862"}
{"text":"Service is top notch.","id":"3292"}
{"text":"The food now is inconsistent.","id":"3343"}
{"text":"All pretty good.","id":"3045"}
{"text":"You can also special order any kind of dumpling,etc.","id":"3135"}
{"text":"you guys rock.","id":"3391"}
{"text":"Chance is a joke.","id":"3651"}
{"text":"I was pretty much full after our fondue appetizer.","id":"2018"}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL before you request extra spice.","id":"3551"}
{"text":"The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.","id":"2355"}
{"text":"We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.","id":"3178"}
{"text":"I was at Rao's last Wed.","id":"586"}
{"text":"And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.","id":"2211"}
{"text":"I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.","id":"2317"}
{"text":"The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.","id":"175"}
{"text":"Service was quick.","id":"1609"}
{"text":"Tends to turn people away.","id":"2706"}
{"text":"We thought this a prelude to what the evening will be like.","id":"1860"}
{"text":"I was turned on to this restaurant by a fellow foodie friend of mine, and have been going back regularly ever since.","id":"961"}
{"text":"Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!","id":"1057"}
{"text":"Went there for an office lunch.","id":"3188"}
{"text":"I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!","id":"65"}
{"text":"Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.","id":"2735"}
{"text":"The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.","id":"2882"}
{"text":"We've been following chef Lyle's food around New York for 15 years and while remaining classic, his innovations with bistro fare have made us return and return.","id":"1948"}
{"text":"The best thing I tasted were the lambchops.","id":"2041"}
{"text":"it's delicious!","id":"1046"}
{"text":"The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had.","id":"1656"}
{"text":"Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.","id":"3440"}
{"text":"In addition, the food is very good and the prices are reasonable.","id":"870"}
{"text":"Upon entering, we were greeted by the owners, Steven and Frederick, who went out of their way to be more than gracious hosts.","id":"2986"}
{"text":"If you live outside the neighborhood, don't bother!","id":"288"}
{"text":"Been going here since it opened have seen the quality value decrease considerably.","id":"284"}
{"text":"Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices.","id":"3418"}
{"text":"I never had anything I didn't like here.","id":"3358"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices.","id":"83"}
{"text":"they bring service up a notch by offerng complementary amuse bouche to all tables and gave us a small dessert for our celebration.","id":"2940"}
{"text":"Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.","id":"2141"}
{"text":"It won't break the bank but I also wouldnt come back for the food.","id":"1854"}
{"text":"All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.","id":"396"}
{"text":"I've been to Joya twice and I will never go again.","id":"3471"}
{"text":"So rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary!","id":"3577"}
{"text":"However it is the ONLY Taiwanese restaurant in town.","id":"2283"}
{"text":"It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.","id":"614"}
{"text":"if you're looking for perfect traditional sushi, go here - if you're looking for interesting combinations, try sushi of gari's (east side).","id":"3012"}
{"text":"No refills on fountain drinks, though.","id":"2621"}
{"text":"Wow over 100 beers to choose from.","id":"605"}
{"text":"Be careful of portions - they're HUGE.","id":"2017"}
{"text":"The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.","id":"2974"}
{"text":"My first time there I happened not to like the Crab Croquette apt that i ordered and they were happy to change it for me without making no big deal.","id":"2456"}
{"text":"Great for large groups and celebrations - our SUPER HAPPY waiter was the entertainment of the evening.","id":"25"}
{"text":"Did I mention the wine?","id":"520"}
{"text":"Plus, on Wednesday nights the house wine is unlimited!","id":"3383"}
{"text":"It is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.","id":"2186"}
{"text":"Now it's so crowded and loud you can't even talk to the person next to you.","id":"3478"}
{"text":"Love Pizza 33..","id":"1283"}
{"text":"Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.","id":"3411"}
{"text":"I'm from England, and Haru's was the best I had in NYC.","id":"3221"}
{"text":"Less = More in their case.","id":"1923"}
{"text":"Ruby Foo's is a tourist trap.","id":"756"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have not been impressed.","id":"1194"}
{"text":"I've been many time and have never been disappointed.","id":"3372"}
{"text":"Ciao Bella","id":"123"}
{"text":"like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.","id":"2522"}
{"text":"The dim sum servings here are a bit larger than I'm used to.","id":"2386"}
{"text":"However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.","id":"3332"}
{"text":"We won't go to this place again for a good meal.","id":"717"}
{"text":"It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.","id":"680"}
{"text":"Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.","id":"1345"}
{"text":"We were treated with attitude ever since the moment we stepped into the restaurant!","id":"3013"}
{"text":"After dinner, take your date to the HUGE dance floor, probably one of the biggest you'll see in NY.","id":"1159"}
{"text":"Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food.","id":"3547"}
{"text":"Has the chef and owner changed???","id":"792"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.","id":"2015"}
{"text":"I absolutely Loved this place.","id":"92"}
{"text":"I wish I lived there as I would eat at this place as often as possible!","id":"548"}
{"text":"But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.","id":"3692"}
{"text":"Outstanding Bagels, but you get what you pay for.","id":"1209"}
{"text":"Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!","id":"443"}
{"text":"If you're in town, it's worth searching for another place.","id":"400"}
{"text":"I have tried the various slice joints around the village but this is by far the best one.","id":"1486"}
{"text":"I found it on a cold night, the perfect spot to warm up.","id":"1377"}
{"text":"They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food!","id":"1439"}
{"text":"Service was warm and attentive, beef carpaachio was exellent (huge portion) and pasta was fresh and well-prepared.","id":"2741"}
{"text":"kalbi and nebbiolo do work together.","id":"370"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).","id":"599"}
{"text":"I will recommend Scopa to all of my friends for a place to go for wonderful Italian food.","id":"803"}
{"text":"Located at the end of a magnificent block.","id":"1750"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not worth the time, effort, or money to say the least.","id":"737"}
{"text":"Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.","id":"847"}
{"text":"Keep up the good work guys!","id":"81"}
{"text":"Hurley's is terrific!","id":"2144"}
{"text":"They don't walk around with the trays of Dim Sum.","id":"1007"}
{"text":"Took my sister here before attending a show one evening.","id":"3687"}
{"text":"Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).","id":"1161"}
{"text":"We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.","id":"3123"}
{"text":"Really.","id":"2301"}
{"text":"I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.","id":"3405"}
{"text":"Our friends have not arrived yet.","id":"3576"}
{"text":"They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.","id":"3702"}
{"text":"I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.","id":"1911"}
{"text":"The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!","id":"703"}
{"text":"My husband and I thougt it would be great to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Pub for our anniversary, and to our surprise it was fantastic.","id":"619"}
{"text":"Never once did I leave feeling unwelcome or impressed.","id":"907"}
{"text":"The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.","id":"1000"}
{"text":"But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.","id":"3241"}
{"text":"I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.","id":"1866"}
{"text":"On a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch.","id":"2570"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and beautifully prepared along with the friendly and personable service.","id":"280"}
{"text":"I usually go there later at night when I get off work so I don't have to deal with crowds or lines.","id":"1021"}
{"text":"Pizza here is consistently good.","id":"1729"}
{"text":"We had a great tiem watching the shows and characters and ar food was just what we were looking for.","id":"610"}
{"text":"After 2 tries by the waiter to take it away (we hadn't even looked at it yet, we had full beers yet to drink), the manager approached and told us they needed the table for people with reservations.","id":"3211"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!","id":"2984"}

{"text":"My husband and I enjoy Sangria.","id":"1855"}
{"text":"But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.","id":"3409"}
{"text":"We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.","id":"579"}
{"text":"First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...","id":"3670"}
{"text":"Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!","id":"685"}
{"text":"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.","id":"428"}
{"text":"Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.","id":"3378"}
{"text":"Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.","id":"779"}
{"text":"The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.","id":"916"}
{"text":"They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.","id":"2194"}
{"text":"Other apetizers and food","id":"1066"}
{"text":"The noodle and rices dishes taste great.","id":"127"}
{"text":"The food's as good as ever.","id":"427"}
{"text":"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.","id":"2298"}
{"text":"Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!","id":"269"}
{"text":"Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.","id":"3169"}
{"text":"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.","id":"3335"}
{"text":"And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.","id":"2356"}
{"text":"The sauces used are also not that exciting.","id":"1199"}
{"text":"The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.","id":"2444"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!","id":"720"}
{"text":"The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.","id":"340"}
{"text":"We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!","id":"228"}
{"text":"The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.","id":"651"}
{"text":"I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.","id":"2664"}
{"text":"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.","id":"1930"}
{"text":"I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.","id":"2090"}
{"text":"There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.","id":"977"}
{"text":"There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.","id":"2433"}
{"text":"If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!","id":"1949"}
{"text":"No thanks!!!","id":"2757"}
{"text":"There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.","id":"301"}
{"text":"I would definently recommend this restaurant.","id":"336"}
{"text":"The prices are wonderfully low.","id":"942"}
{"text":"If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.","id":"2887"}
{"text":"I lOVE THIS PLACE!","id":"80"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.","id":"2398"}
{"text":"So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.","id":"53"}
{"text":"A big disappointment, all around.","id":"1475"}
{"text":"And its absolutely DELICIOUS.","id":"1560"}
{"text":"No free drink.","id":"2025"}
{"text":"I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.","id":"1760"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.","id":"259"}
{"text":"Definitely Highly NOT recommended.","id":"2829"}
{"text":"While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.","id":"1211"}
{"text":"I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.","id":"177"}
{"text":"The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.","id":"1312"}
{"text":"Don't waste money on decor.","id":"1565"}
{"text":"They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?","id":"2959"}
{"text":"go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!","id":"3339"}
{"text":"I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.","id":"1659"}
{"text":"Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.","id":"839"}
{"text":"I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.","id":"457"}
{"text":"my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.","id":"1306"}
{"text":"While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.","id":"3086"}
{"text":"I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.","id":"2466"}
{"text":"Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.","id":"531"}
{"text":"Their eggplant is so delicate, sweet tender!","id":"450"}
{"text":"I pray it stays open forever.","id":"121"}
{"text":"Each bite of food at Kai was indeed delicious, fresh, and elegant.","id":"3263"}
{"text":"all the food was excellent - considering the quality of food in most moderately priced restaurants is mediocre this was slightly more pricey and well worth it.","id":"2939"}
{"text":"If you want to save some money, don't go here.","id":"1678"}
{"text":"My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.","id":"2606"}
{"text":"I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).","id":"2019"}
{"text":"It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service.","id":"1797"}
{"text":"This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right.","id":"404"}
{"text":"You should pass on the calamari.","id":"1731"}
{"text":"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.","id":"2791"}
{"text":"Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.","id":"3261"}
{"text":"THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.","id":"1586"}
{"text":"The fries are yummy.","id":"1893"}
{"text":"Friendly and informative staff, very attentive and prompt raw bar service.","id":"309"}
{"text":"Best Taiwanese food in NY!","id":"2290"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.","id":"3601"}
{"text":"This place is a great stop for great food.","id":"736"}
{"text":"All the pastas are fantastic and the homemade lasagna is some of the best that I have had in the City.","id":"2784"}
{"text":"What for?","id":"2825"}
{"text":"Fantastic!","id":"1741"}
{"text":"they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.","id":"2118"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for a first date.","id":"84"}
{"text":"We laughed when he finally offered us a dessert menu and we left a 10 percent tip, which was generous, I feel.","id":"369"}
{"text":"And the prices were way to high for what you get.","id":"3279"}
{"text":"But people from Sichuan will die for it)  - Chongqing Hot Pot, chongqing was the biggest city of Sichuan, now became an independent province.","id":"1425"}
{"text":"Skip Baroanda down the street (Eurotrashy, snooty and expensive) and check this place out!","id":"2743"}
{"text":"Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.","id":"3324"}
{"text":"The staff ignored my friends and I the entire time we were there.","id":"1792"}
{"text":"Yet paired with such rude service, would never recommend for anyone interested in carrying any kind of conversation while there.","id":"166"}
{"text":"I went to Areo on a Sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends, and spent three enjoyable hours there.","id":"1679"}
{"text":"The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.","id":"1727"}
{"text":"I need at least three rolls to be full, and that's at least $14.00!","id":"2425"}
{"text":"Anyone who ever dined at a thai restaurant is in for a huge disappointment.","id":"3532"}
{"text":"All of it was simply amazing, unique and tasty and best of all it didn't break the bank.","id":"3455"}
{"text":"Great wine list, reasonably priced.--Sara","id":"3508"}
{"text":"The hot dogs were cold in the middle and the buns were stale.","id":"1541"}
{"text":"While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).","id":"1037"}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup is good as well.","id":"2288"}
{"text":"I was so sad to read the bad reviews this place got!","id":"2955"}
{"text":"Delivery service is great too.","id":"2585"}
{"text":"The food's dazzling flavors overwhelm the palate, truly embracing the beauty of authentic Thai cuisine.","id":"1386"}
{"text":"I recieved prompt service with a smile.","id":"1378"}
{"text":"They pray to their Food Gods to make them into a good pizza like VT's.","id":"438"}
{"text":"The place was quiet and delightful.","id":"232"}
{"text":"Molto bene!","id":"2764"}
{"text":".the best I've found outside of the Chinatown masters.","id":"3246"}
{"text":"They are amazing!","id":"2473"}
{"text":"Avoid this place!","id":"3051"}
{"text":"The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.","id":"3621"}
{"text":"A must try!","id":"2579"}
{"text":"As much as I like the food there, I can't bring myself to go back.","id":"3489"}
{"text":"It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.","id":"3600"}
{"text":"The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.","id":"3519"}
{"text":"The soup is pretty good too.","id":"1183"}
{"text":"It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.","id":"2663"}
{"text":"I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.","id":"857"}
{"text":"If you go to Roth's try to be served by Mike, he is GREAT!!","id":"1118"}
{"text":"Based on a visit a month ago, I returned the week before Christmas and was hugely disappointed.","id":"2484"}
{"text":"Went here on a friend's reccomendation.","id":"576"}
{"text":"not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .","id":"2915"}
{"text":"I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.","id":"3166"}
{"text":"I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh.","id":"662"}
{"text":"The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!","id":"3599"}
{"text":"We were very surprised by how good the food was on our first visit here on a Sunday night.","id":"502"}
{"text":"Nha Trang, while being notorious for utter lack of comfort and decor, horribly slow wait staff and horribly quick meals, is one of the best vietnamese restaurants i've ever been to. the pho is delicious and comes with very fresh vegtables.","id":"981"}
{"text":"On the other hand, if you are not fooled easily, you will find hundreds of restaurants that will give you service and ambiance that is on par with Alain Ducasse, and food that will outshine in presentaion, taste, choice, quality and quantity.","id":"1987"}
{"text":"We will definitely go back.","id":"2889"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.","id":"1287"}
{"text":"Is just the way it was in days gone by.","id":"476"}
{"text":"If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.","id":"3626"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!!!","id":"1094"}
{"text":"Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.","id":"2881"}
{"text":"The portions are now very small, the sauces are overly-ambitious usually inedible while the service is still good, the restaurant, due to its popularity, seems frantic.","id":"285"}
{"text":"For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.","id":"700"}
{"text":"The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!","id":"1493"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great!!!","id":"1014"}
{"text":"It can be a very fun experience with a group, and kids (6 and over) would love it.","id":"674"}
{"text":"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.","id":"953"}
{"text":"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.","id":"405"}
{"text":"The service is a little scatty at times but all is forgiven when the food arrives.","id":"3141"}
{"text":"The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.","id":"466"}
{"text":"And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.","id":"1899"}
{"text":"The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .","id":"729"}
{"text":"The pickles were great addition.","id":"487"}
{"text":"If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.","id":"1434"}
{"text":"You must try the shrimp appetizers.","id":"3410"}
{"text":"Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming.","id":"1050"}
{"text":"Filled with suits, though, so you never really feel terribly comfortable.","id":"1981"}
{"text":"The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part.","id":"1991"}
{"text":"Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.","id":"2035"}
{"text":"my wife and i have been going to nyc for years and wouldn't miss roxy,s food is expensive but it's new york!","id":"3587"}
{"text":"It's like you are transported to the Italian countryside, very romantic and filled with antiques.","id":"2851"}
{"text":"The cold appetizer dishes taste like the way I remember them to taste when I was growing up in Taiwan.","id":"2294"}
{"text":"Just go and see for yourself.","id":"2726"}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.","id":"1680"}
{"text":"Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.","id":"3605"}
{"text":"I hate this.","id":"3624"}
{"text":"Any if you have a reservation you'll wait for max 5 minutes - so have a drink at the bar.","id":"1671"}
{"text":"Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.","id":"2767"}
{"text":"That place was awesome,,,  sally !","id":"1155"}
{"text":"The food at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine.","id":"3327"}
{"text":"Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!","id":"1700"}
{"text":"get over it!","id":"3589"}
{"text":"But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.","id":"898"}
{"text":"However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.","id":"2429"}
{"text":"While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it.","id":"483"}
{"text":"However, looking at the table next to ours, we both sort of wished we had ordered pizza, which looked PERRRRRRRRRFECT.","id":"359"}
{"text":"Priced at upper intermediate range.","id":"2795"}
{"text":"The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.","id":"342"}
{"text":"I recommend ordering in on a weeknight.","id":"1239"}
{"text":"If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.","id":"767"}
{"text":"Try the olive cream cheese or the lox spread on a whole wheat everything bagel.","id":"3157"}
{"text":"While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.","id":"2123"}
{"text":"So my husband made up an excuse so we can leave.","id":"1861"}
{"text":"It's very spicy but not offensive.","id":"2888"}
{"text":"they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.","id":"2938"}
{"text":"I don't know who they think they are but they have no respect for the residents of the neighborhood ever since they opened their cabaret next door and blasts loud music till three in the morning every weekend during the summer.","id":"2544"}
{"text":"The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.","id":"408"}
{"text":"They used shredded cheese on top!","id":"3703"}
{"text":"They are located in the middle of Chinatown!","id":"129"}
{"text":"The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.","id":"529"}
{"text":"Eating at Ottimo is like eating in Chef Salvatore Esposito's home.","id":"3504"}
{"text":"Katz's deli is a great NY experience.","id":"475"}
{"text":"Check it out.","id":"2568"}
{"text":"The only positive was the wait staff, which was prompt, knowledgable, and likeable.","id":"1677"}
{"text":"I couldn't reccommend their Godmother pizza any higher.","id":"2554"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.","id":"1412"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by this low-key upper eastsider and their authentically thai cuisine!!!","id":"2251"}
{"text":"i would go again if i didn't have to pay.","id":"808"}
{"text":"For the location, the prices are very reasonable.","id":"991"}
{"text":"The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.","id":"2284"}
{"text":"My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).","id":"3531"}
{"text":"I ordered the crab cocktail and it was soaked in a lime juice concoction where all you could taste was the lime.","id":"2654"}
{"text":"I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don't have to rush off to a show.","id":"1869"}
{"text":"We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.","id":"550"}
{"text":"Hopefully next time, I will save room for dessert.","id":"3243"}
{"text":"Alain Ducasse is the best of everything, I mean everything was excelent.I","id":"1995"}
{"text":"Not a typical pizza joint, but good for a low key and fairly cheap nice sit down dinner.","id":"2316"}
{"text":"The corned beef was tender and melted in my mouth.","id":"486"}
{"text":"GO HERE.","id":"1290"}
{"text":"The best Chicken pad tai, I've ever had.","id":"3469"}
{"text":"We weren't even at our table for more than an hour total.","id":"3574"}
{"text":"$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.","id":"1662"}
{"text":"It has been my first choice ever since I discovered it .","id":"2584"}
{"text":"Over 100 different choices to create your own.","id":"2578"}
{"text":"Haru serves very fresh fish, has a trendy, modern ambiance, prime location on Park Avenue South and friendly service.","id":"3205"}
{"text":"Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.","id":"528"}
{"text":"Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience.","id":"82"}
{"text":"We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?","id":"2640"}
{"text":"I almost wanted to write a bad review, so no one would ever go here and I could have all the dumplings to myself!","id":"1176"}
{"text":"After reading the posts, I was always skeptical to go to The Minnow, despite living in Park Slope.","id":"3237"}
{"text":"I loved it and will be back soon.","id":"291"}
{"text":"Always a nice crowd, but never loud.","id":"3643"}
{"text":"My turkey burger was not cooked at all, my friends salmon was completely raw.","id":"40"}
{"text":"The service is spotty, sometimes really friendly and sometimes barely there.","id":"3111"}
{"text":"Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend.","id":"1340"}
{"text":"His drinks are very inventive, delicious and classy.","id":"1111"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service.","id":"2622"}
{"text":"This isn't your corner Chinese food takeout.","id":"3259"}
{"text":"Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.","id":"1279"}
{"text":"This place, however, has a lot less pretension than Joya and the Thai food is still above-average.","id":"2495"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here after reading reviews here as well as hobokeni.com,","id":"469"}
{"text":"Try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!","id":"3040"}
{"text":"Told us to sit anywhere, and when we sat he said the table was reserved.","id":"513"}
{"text":"uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison.","id":"3011"}
{"text":"We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.","id":"3454"}
{"text":"The crispy chicken wasn't for us, though.","id":"3248"}
{"text":"JUST AWSOME.","id":"2058"}
{"text":"Food is great.","id":"3291"}
{"text":"There is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me.","id":"3190"}
{"text":"I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!","id":"2693"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly tiny.","id":"3127"}
{"text":"I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!","id":"1998"}
{"text":"I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.","id":"1904"}
{"text":"This is one of our all-time favorite.","id":"454"}
{"text":"In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.","id":"772"}
{"text":"The wine is always good, the tapas are always yummy, especially with the warm pita bread.","id":"3676"}
{"text":"But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.","id":"3667"}
{"text":"this place is amazingly bad.","id":"2520"}
{"text":"Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.","id":"668"}
{"text":"I've been to several places for Dim Sum and this has got to be the WORST.","id":"1006"}
{"text":"I love this place.","id":"2401"}
{"text":"The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.","id":"3460"}
{"text":"Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.","id":"1621"}
{"text":"It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.","id":"2204"}
{"text":"Dinner took almost 4 hours without any lag time.","id":"2003"}
{"text":"The people in the restaurant were pretty obnoxious and loud.","id":"1041"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.","id":"1089"}
{"text":"The problem is just that-it is a sometimes kind of affair.","id":"1236"}
{"text":"Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.","id":"3710"}
{"text":"The fried rice is really good too.","id":"663"}
{"text":"We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.","id":"276"}
{"text":"Made my dining experience uncomfortable.","id":"1532"}
{"text":"It's a steal!","id":"1277"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant based on prior internet comments.","id":"222"}
{"text":"still stay away, the table next to us walked out after my table and aanother were serves eventhough they were there much longer...","id":"1509"}
{"text":"I was with a party of 7 (close but not next the the front doors) and we were eating with our coats on.","id":"2220"}
{"text":"A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.","id":"518"}
{"text":"THe back garden sitting area is very pleasant, where you can see their personal herb garden.","id":"2595"}
{"text":"What's the difference between the two?","id":"2260"}
{"text":"Will go back but only sate those homesick stomach cravings!","id":"2885"}
{"text":"Good French restaurant in an area devoid of decent restaurants unless you're into eating 4 pound pastrami sandwiches at Katz' Deli, or Mexican food which is supplied by capable restaurants.","id":"2967"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this restaurant.","id":"3147"}
{"text":"The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.","id":"2187"}
{"text":"We also had shared a house salad that was fresh.","id":"3639"}
{"text":"The ceiling is amazing!","id":"2852"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in NYC celebrating our 30th anniversary.","id":"221"}
{"text":"I'm glad I was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in NY.","id":"2913"}
{"text":"And at the conclusion of this culinary nightmare the check was given to our table by knocking over a glass of water.","id":"297"}
{"text":"Not a small feat for good french food in the area.","id":"2964"}
{"text":"The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.","id":"2502"}
{"text":"Food was average but tasty.","id":"28"}
{"text":"We come from New Jersey to eat at Kinoko.","id":"1654"}
{"text":"Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.","id":"131"}
{"text":"Will never be back.","id":"3218"}
{"text":"The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.","id":"1874"}
{"text":"I highly recommend it.","id":"616"}
{"text":"Oh and it's too tiny for families with strollers.","id":"3611"}
{"text":"The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.","id":"1580"}
{"text":"With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.","id":"2924"}
{"text":"The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.","id":"2414"}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.","id":"2218"}
{"text":"my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).","id":"1436"}
{"text":"Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.","id":"2279"}
{"text":"Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.","id":"2975"}
{"text":"My six year old loved it.","id":"1568"}
{"text":"Pizza was a little soggy.","id":"3496"}
{"text":"The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.","id":"3084"}
{"text":"The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever.","id":"3033"}
{"text":"The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.","id":"3321"}
{"text":"The wine list is interesting and has many good values.","id":"699"}
{"text":"Murray won't do it.","id":"3173"}
{"text":"I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.","id":"1370"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.","id":"3340"}
{"text":"Definite go if you're used to good Indian restaurant food from abroad.","id":"3334"}
{"text":"THR AT MOSHPHERE IS COMPACT, MODERN, YET COZY.","id":"2463"}
{"text":"By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.","id":"2297"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food in cute - though a bit dank - little Nolita hangout, BUT service terrible.","id":"1353"}
{"text":"Most people eat there seem to be typical Upper East Side snobs, so be aware.","id":"3274"}
{"text":"The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.","id":"2668"}
{"text":"The food is mostly made from scratch, fresh and well prepared.","id":"2538"}
{"text":"Worse of all, $60 was erroneously added to our $80 bill.","id":"3060"}
{"text":"Too cold to enjoy.","id":"2221"}
{"text":"NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.","id":"2582"}
{"text":"Try the sea bass.","id":"2071"}
{"text":"$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.","id":"1645"}
{"text":"I brought some buddies from CA and they loved it.","id":"2257"}
{"text":"Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.","id":"743"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't anything spectacular for the price.","id":"765"}
{"text":"During our meal, the management came over and checked on us and even bought us a round of drinks.","id":"2133"}
{"text":"But they don't have a toaster, which is strange.","id":"1054"}
{"text":"So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.","id":"1040"}
{"text":"The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.","id":"2278"}
{"text":"A must for all the Dosa lovers.","id":"1324"}
{"text":"The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.","id":"1477"}
{"text":"The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.","id":"3059"}
{"text":"Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.","id":"2365"}
{"text":"The exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations.","id":"264"}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.","id":"3525"}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian, this really isn't a good place to go.","id":"485"}
{"text":"Try the mediterranean salad, it is a true experience for your taste buds!!","id":"731"}
{"text":"I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.","id":"3025"}
{"text":"Of course, it is crowded but who cares.","id":"239"}
{"text":"This quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my Manhattan restaurant list.","id":"2765"}
{"text":"I've been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences.","id":"686"}
{"text":"People are always friendly.","id":"1564"}
{"text":"The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!","id":"1069"}
{"text":"From the entrees to the sides to the drinks, everything was creatively prepared yet still simple.","id":"3118"}
{"text":"hmmm.","id":"1814"}
{"text":"Service was prompt and courteous.","id":"744"}
{"text":"It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef.","id":"1382"}
{"text":"Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.","id":"3665"}
{"text":"It was nice and fresh, but I can't give it high scores on being authentic thai.","id":"1128"}
{"text":"Overall, worht every penny.","id":"780"}
{"text":"When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.","id":"2819"}
{"text":"Got club soda, filled with ice, no lime.","id":"566"}
{"text":"Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.","id":"2646"}
{"text":"This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.","id":"1576"}
{"text":"My mouth starts to water merely thinking about the delight that is this restaurant.","id":"3223"}
{"text":"I haven't been to the other locations.","id":"3214"}
{"text":"Oh, and the complimentary pudding dessert was just enough- yummy!","id":"3434"}
{"text":"People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.","id":"2687"}
{"text":"we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap.","id":"2064"}
{"text":"Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.","id":"1191"}
{"text":"We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.","id":"626"}
{"text":"Decent wine selection too.","id":"1673"}
{"text":"Go with a group of friends and you will have a great time.","id":"1706"}
{"text":"It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.","id":"1879"}
{"text":"I have to say I have never had a disapointing meal here.","id":"2637"}
{"text":"It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.","id":"3623"}
{"text":"The place does get crowded, so I recommend going between 4-5 PM.","id":"2420"}
{"text":"Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).","id":"2605"}
{"text":"Disappointing food, lousy service.","id":"1415"}
{"text":"I'm from sichuan, this is the restaurant I recommend going.","id":"1421"}
{"text":"This lovely French-Asian fusion restaurant stands out amongst other great restaurants on Smith Street.","id":"3660"}
{"text":"If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place.","id":"1945"}
{"text":"great place to go for a drink too because they have 100 kinds of beer.","id":"612"}
{"text":"But this place is a well-oiled machine so they know what they're doing.","id":"44"}
{"text":"Over price, and small portions .","id":"2916"}
{"text":"Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.","id":"859"}
{"text":"But I'd go back","id":"855"}
{"text":"Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.","id":"514"}
{"text":"The food was well prepared and the service impecable.","id":"750"}
{"text":"BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.","id":"2645"}
{"text":"Good, dark atmosphere and the music is a nice touch.","id":"2267"}
{"text":"My husband said the portions were very small, but if my main course was good to eat the portion would've been fine for me.","id":"2453"}
{"text":"But the thai is definitely not great -- bland and indistinguished.","id":"2193"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is a couple blocks away from Sripraphai (another delicious Thai restaurant).","id":"1392"}
{"text":"Great for groups, great for a date, great for early brunch or a nightcap.","id":"4"}
{"text":"Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.","id":"240"}
{"text":"Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.","id":"2030"}
{"text":"Perhaps the last reviewer (who stated she was treated with attitude) lives in a parallel universe because I have never had anything but a perfect experience at Yasuda.","id":"3000"}
{"text":"That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.","id":"2842"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was special.","id":"2005"}
{"text":"Because we didn't have a reservation, we could only sit in the back garden, but it was great, secluded and perfect in nice weather.","id":"3239"}
{"text":"Stuffing yourself with Japanese food is a rare thing.","id":"1660"}
{"text":"I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.","id":"1145"}
{"text":"While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.","id":"2855"}
{"text":"It is expensive but well worth the money.","id":"652"}
{"text":"Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.","id":"2774"}
{"text":"Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.","id":"1575"}
{"text":"i would recommend reservations on weekends though.","id":"2908"}
{"text":"There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1.","id":"423"}
{"text":"Great pizza for lunch place.","id":"1608"}
{"text":"The food was very expensive (we spent $160 for lunch for two) but extremely tasty.","id":"835"}
{"text":"I don't think I would go again.","id":"1431"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 and well seved.","id":"377"}
{"text":"And that's no mean feat...","id":"3222"}
{"text":"I often go there to eat with my family.","id":"125"}
{"text":"I wish they would change back to what it was before.","id":"3342"}
{"text":"The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.","id":"2808"}
{"text":"NO PIZZA 33 for me!","id":"1298"}
{"text":"I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken.","id":"2183"}
{"text":"I'm no food critic, but I'd like to think I have a tiny bit of experience under my belt having lived in NY for the last 11 years.","id":"2841"}
{"text":"I noted it was crossed off on the bill.","id":"1418"}
{"text":"Needless to say, I'm never going back and you should be wary too.","id":"2208"}
{"text":"Best dish is nori-wrapped tuna.","id":"287"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing!!","id":"814"}
{"text":"Some servers make you feel like they are doing you a favor to bring you the food.","id":"3112"}
{"text":"An excellent alternative to fast food joints and ordering in but, the food was slightly disappointing.","id":"2413"}
{"text":"Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.","id":"3435"}
{"text":"I work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time.","id":"914"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and another couple.","id":"2695"}
{"text":"The staff is also attentive and friendly.","id":"664"}
{"text":"The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.","id":"1644"}
{"text":"That is a problem since we paid about 20 bucks a dish, and had to order 5 dishes to get a decent taste.","id":"2036"}
{"text":"This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.","id":"1880"}
{"text":"They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.","id":"2101"}
{"text":"first it took us a long time to find the place.","id":"2113"}
{"text":"All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!","id":"1822"}
{"text":"It is about FOOD and Ambiance, and imagine how dreadful it will be it we only had to listen to an idle engine.","id":"2537"}
{"text":"The food was good too.","id":"1594"}
{"text":"We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.","id":"3459"}
{"text":"Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.","id":"3572"}
{"text":"The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!","id":"845"}
{"text":"Admittedly, this is not the place for gigantic pieces of fish overflowing the plate (and thank goodness, in my opinion) but for simple, elegant sushi there is no better place in New York or anywhere in the US.","id":"3004"}
{"text":"I am a die hard peep lover.","id":"2441"}
{"text":"Once you become a regular, you are treated as one.","id":"965"}
{"text":"The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.","id":"1327"}
{"text":"Everyone treats you like you were part of the family.","id":"1615"}
{"text":"The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.","id":"2681"}
{"text":"The rest of the menu is limited by everything is good eats.","id":"3361"}
{"text":"The menu is nothing like the one on the website.","id":"789"}
{"text":"Great food, great lay out and awesome service.","id":"782"}
{"text":"Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.","id":"3148"}
{"text":"SEA has become so popular that they've let it go to their heads.","id":"2203"}
{"text":"We walked in on a Wednesday night and were seated promptly.","id":"3661"}
{"text":"Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.","id":"1403"}
{"text":"The wait staff is very freindly, they make it feel like you're eating in a freindly little european town.","id":"3682"}
{"text":"Oh yeah ever on the west side try there sister resturant Arties Cafe.","id":"2727"}
{"text":"(Besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city).","id":"2293"}
{"text":"My roommate and I LOVE this place.","id":"2119"}
{"text":"The waitstaff are all very busy, it's not outstanding service, but I've never been dealt with rudely.","id":"205"}
{"text":"I have lived in Japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in Japan.","id":"655"}
{"text":"Not worth it.","id":"2092"}
{"text":"In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.","id":"749"}
{"text":"They have it all -- great price, food, and service.","id":"132"}
{"text":"So close, but not good enough.","id":"3176"}
{"text":"This was on a Tuesday night.","id":"367"}
{"text":"Its also a bit of a hassle to get to without a car (I happen to live in Inwood).","id":"3397"}
{"text":"The flavors are great, and the menu is extensive.","id":"3382"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was so attentive and personable, and how about that ambience!","id":"2850"}
{"text":"This place has the best interior I have seen anywhere in the northside of W'burg, and will impress whoever you bring there.","id":"708"}
{"text":"The food has been consistant for years and it never lets you down.","id":"978"}
{"text":"I found the variety of the sashimi plate to be satisfying - fresh and yummy.","id":"1029"}
{"text":"And forget what you read under me, the atmosphere isn't that bad either.","id":"3470"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time, or money!!","id":"3034"}
{"text":"They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.","id":"3180"}
{"text":"We couldn't carry our conversation as we were routinely interrupted by waitress and servants asking us to order and hinting that we're taking too much time -- amazing, we just sat down.","id":"163"}
{"text":"sometimes i get good food and ok service.","id":"1017"}
{"text":"We just ate at Kai and were disapointed.","id":"3277"}
{"text":"It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.","id":"757"}
{"text":"This was a great surprise.","id":"923"}
{"text":"After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.","id":"472"}
{"text":"The food was spicy and delicious.","id":"2223"}
{"text":"I went with my fiance on a Tuesday evening.","id":"849"}
{"text":"A little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite.","id":"1035"}
{"text":"It was wonderful.","id":"3196"}
{"text":"Went for a late weekday lunch.","id":"1339"}
{"text":"I just don't understand all the hype...","id":"3131"}
{"text":"Bartender was unable to tear himself away from friends at bar.","id":"3649"}
{"text":"Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.","id":"1140"}
{"text":"Dahkin also offers prix fixe lunch and buffet.","id":"2337"}
{"text":"Although the place could be a little more eye catching and roomier, at the same time, it doesn't really matter.","id":"1174"}
{"text":"You can barely see who you are with never mind have a conversation.","id":"3474"}
{"text":"This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.","id":"2818"}
{"text":"I don't get it either.","id":"2920"}
{"text":"Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.","id":"162"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a hot bagel on the way to work.","id":"1216"}
{"text":"It's like they took leftover chicken, poured oil and sprinkled pepper powder over it (the sauce was translucent and red).","id":"3530"}
{"text":"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.","id":"951"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Manhattan.","id":"1005"}
{"text":"They brought glasses and the bottle, and just left the bottle at our table.","id":"1619"}
{"text":"We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.","id":"1304"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to nice glass of Sangria when we arrived.","id":"1856"}
{"text":"I would highly recommand requesting a table by the window.","id":"3318"}
{"text":"While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.","id":"1335"}
{"text":"I for one will never patronize them again.","id":"2545"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this great pizzeria as I explored my new neighborhood.","id":"1821"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.","id":"880"}
{"text":"The service, however, was a bright flower in a garden.","id":"401"}
{"text":"So, again, give it a try.","id":"1238"}
{"text":"Stay far away from this place.","id":"889"}
{"text":"We will come back!!!","id":"21"}
{"text":"We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.","id":"2944"}
{"text":"The food is very good too but for the most part, it's just regular food, nothing special.","id":"3298"}
{"text":"A touch more jalapeno heat for contrast and it would have been very good indeed.","id":"1344"}
{"text":"Tried the pad see ew on the recommendation of the last reviewer since it's one of my favorite dishes.","id":"1381"}
{"text":"We'd go back again","id":"581"}
{"text":"We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.","id":"3658"}
{"text":"The location is perfect.","id":"1840"}
{"text":"Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.","id":"2702"}
{"text":"The lunch special is an asbolute steal.","id":"3536"}
{"text":"This food is asian-air fusion.","id":"1363"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but really good food with pretty reasonable price.","id":"1065"}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.","id":"2137"}
{"text":"While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.","id":"2884"}
{"text":"i'm surprised about some of the bad reviews posted here - i've been to tamarind about 5 or 6 times and always come away extremely satisfied and looking forward to returning.","id":"2075"}
{"text":"But on a lazy Saturday night, we ended up going.","id":"3238"}
{"text":"There are a few Italian employees who may not speak the best English but for me that adds to the experience.","id":"558"}
{"text":"I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.","id":"3597"}
{"text":"Once for dinner and once for brunch.","id":"1099"}
{"text":"I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.","id":"169"}
{"text":"Not worth the prices.","id":"2042"}
{"text":"Would recommend - perfect for those looking for a place close to grand central.","id":"1603"}
{"text":"From the moment you enter till the moment you walk out the friendly and helpful staff was was just Fantastic.","id":"1114"}
{"text":"Service was good and food is wonderful.","id":"233"}
{"text":"I only have friends.","id":"1832"}
{"text":"She gets 10 for her excellent service and advice.","id":"3276"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal","id":"960"}
{"text":"being a fan of spicy ethnic foods, indian included, i made friends with this place long ago.","id":"3555"}
{"text":"Please save yourself the frustration.","id":"2863"}
{"text":"And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.","id":"2477"}
{"text":"The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!","id":"1095"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.","id":"696"}
{"text":"(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!","id":"62"}
{"text":"If your visiting, you'll enjoy the ambiance and the fact that it's in Time Sq...","id":"768"}
{"text":"We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some food?","id":"3636"}
{"text":"sandwiches tho pricey are over stuffed - can serve 2 persons easily thus cost effective!","id":"3695"}
{"text":"And comparing it to the Chinatown restaurants is simply not fair.","id":"3256"}
{"text":"Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money.","id":"211"}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere - felt like I was in Paris.","id":"524"}
{"text":"Every course was better than the next.","id":"801"}
{"text":"Not cheap, but not that expensive either.","id":"3431"}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly helpful and attentive.","id":"266"}
{"text":"If presentation and service is your thing, then this magic show works.","id":"1986"}
{"text":"Apparently, the good cook works then.","id":"1240"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly suprised.","id":"955"}
{"text":"The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.","id":"1787"}
{"text":"One less manhattanite the better.","id":"682"}
{"text":"Everyone is welcomed in as family.","id":"2131"}
{"text":"I ate clams oreganta and spectacular salad with perfectly marinated cucumbers and tomatoes with lots of shrimp and basil.","id":"2349"}
{"text":"The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.","id":"2485"}
{"text":"Spice is sleek, modern and cool with a menu that will not hurt your wallet.","id":"2412"}
{"text":"Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.","id":"2647"}
{"text":"Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.","id":"2311"}
{"text":"Very affordable and excellent ambient!","id":"714"}
{"text":"Look elsewhere.","id":"3057"}
{"text":"More important, the sushi rivals the best in Tokyo.","id":"3002"}
{"text":"I have never had cheescake like this.","id":"2616"}
{"text":"Bill a little high, but worth it.","id":"2969"}
{"text":"I seriously doubt I will ever dine at Jimmy's Bronx, or for that matter, Jimmy's Uptown, again.","id":"1147"}
{"text":"Everyone I bring here always loves it.","id":"3521"}
{"text":"My co-workers had to wait almost an hour for delivery, only to discover that what they got was not what they ordered.","id":"2410"}
{"text":"Worth a visit.","id":"2099"}
{"text":"A real dissapointment.","id":"2792"}
{"text":"Its a go-to for dates as well as entertaining out of town guests.","id":"3206"}
{"text":"Why do people rave about the ambience.","id":"837"}
{"text":"Were meeting up with some friends for a drink at Lafayette 161 and happened to walk by Thai Angel famished.","id":"1244"}
{"text":"Fluke sashimi drizzled with jalapeno-lime olive oil, the fruit of the oil nicely highlighting the fish's sweetness.","id":"1343"}
{"text":"Great sushi experience.","id":"348"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to Del Frisco's!","id":"1956"}
{"text":"They charge $6.00 for rice.","id":"2039"}
{"text":"My steak au poivre was one of the worst I've had.","id":"2990"}
{"text":"On a recent Sunday afternoon, a friend and I accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play DOUBT.","id":"2135"}
{"text":"The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.","id":"1779"}
{"text":"Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.","id":"142"}
{"text":"Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.","id":"2768"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).","id":"812"}
{"text":"From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.","id":"218"}
{"text":"I will be going back and heartily recommend it!","id":"91"}
{"text":"Would definitely visit again.","id":"2970"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the trip to Battery Park City!","id":"1004"}
{"text":"Perhaps this food is considered extreme to an Upper East Side resident, but for the rest of us who've actually eaten ethnic food, this is simply dull.","id":"1204"}
{"text":"The place was real empty but that was because this was the first Sunday they ever opened.","id":"811"}
{"text":"This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.","id":"2239"}

{"text":"Both are delicious, the cooks are friendly and are willing to take a moment and speak to you and shake your hand.","id":"1606"}
{"text":"so i thought why not change it up a bit.","id":"1307"}
{"text":"My friend ordered some of their special sushi rolls which had excellent presentation and tasted great!","id":"300"}
{"text":"Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.","id":"2334"}
{"text":"The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.","id":"2079"}
{"text":"P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.","id":"2602"}
{"text":"my picks are:  - Scallion Pancake (fried with vegetable juice, very special and tasty)  - Guizhou Chicken  - Shredded Squid Family Style (one of my personal favorites)  - Sichuan Spicy Soft Shell Crab  - Shuizhu Fish (this one is for hardcore Sichuan food fans, I wouldn't recommend to my American friends as it's very spicy.","id":"1424"}
{"text":"They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.","id":"1294"}
{"text":"To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.","id":"2361"}
{"text":"There was a great deal for 6 Blue Point oysters and a beer or glass of wine for $8!","id":"316"}
{"text":"I really liked the noodle dishes at Rice Avenue compared to their Green Curry dish.","id":"1393"}
{"text":"I went to pams with my girlfriend, and i love it.","id":"3182"}
{"text":"But for whatever reason, prices are about twice as high.","id":"1317"}
{"text":"I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.","id":"1213"}
{"text":"Great atmoshere and worth every bit.","id":"1281"}
{"text":"We had a most unpleasant experience at this restaurant.","id":"1537"}
{"text":"The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!","id":"2262"}
{"text":"The staff was knowledgeable and full of personality.","id":"3456"}
{"text":"Great staff.","id":"1738"}
{"text":"Only complaint would be that at an average cost of $12-$15 per meal, I'd like not to have to worry about finding a seat!","id":"1081"}
{"text":"To finish off such a delightful dinner experience you must have dessert, especially the White Chocolate Bread Pudding with Gelato and hot chocolate.","id":"1117"}
{"text":"The banana tower is an amazing dessert as well.","id":"306"}
{"text":"I went there with my friend last saturday.","id":"2112"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service.","id":"94"}
{"text":"A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.","id":"1015"}
{"text":"Great vibe, lots of people.","id":"1901"}
{"text":"I like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down.","id":"2422"}
{"text":"Just an odd group.","id":"200"}
{"text":"The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.","id":"1607"}
{"text":"Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.","id":"2771"}
{"text":"I love this place!","id":"1400"}
{"text":"it is not consistent.","id":"1019"}
{"text":"But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.","id":"2793"}
{"text":"Great food and the prices are very reasonable.","id":"2332"}
{"text":"Wine list is not huge but def well selected.","id":"215"}
{"text":"A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.","id":"58"}
{"text":"Be sure to try the seasonal, and always delicious, specials.","id":"536"}
{"text":"The ambience is authentic and relaxing and we have always received attentive and prompt service.","id":"869"}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic, french cuisine in substantial portions.","id":"2961"}
{"text":"Drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon.","id":"1355"}
{"text":"The one vegetarian entree (Abby's treasure) was actually quite a surprise - it was delicious and had wintermelon covering an assortment of fresh mushrooms and vegetables.","id":"2085"}
{"text":"At 5 dumplings for $1, you just cannot go wrong.","id":"1173"}
{"text":"But the pizza is way to expensive.","id":"1470"}
{"text":"And the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!","id":"2457"}
{"text":"Even better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.","id":"505"}
{"text":"Service was decent, but not as smooth as I would expect from a place with these prices and reputation.","id":"842"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Naples 45 a month ago on a visit to NYC.","id":"1595"}
{"text":"Good drink.","id":"2150"}

{"text":"Was there Friday night.","id":"3706"}
{"text":"We had a girls' night dinner here for restaurant week.","id":"2010"}
{"text":"Romantic if you want it to be (brightly lit).","id":"3064"}
{"text":"However, I was there for a work dinner not long ago when my colleague from London noticed a very large waterbug on the ceiling.","id":"3483"}
{"text":"I recommend it!","id":"1719"}
{"text":"I have taken practically every guest that has come to visit me in NY and hooked a few New Yorkers onto Peep as well.","id":"2442"}
{"text":"enough said!","id":"3101"}
{"text":"I don't live in NY but my best friend does.","id":"542"}
{"text":"My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.","id":"255"}
{"text":"Even though I made the reservation at 3pm for the same night through Dinnerbroker, we were seated at a table with one of the best view!","id":"828"}
{"text":"we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.","id":"3553"}
{"text":"I didn't take a look at the rest menu, but the oysters were fantastic.","id":"315"}
{"text":"After the review I treked into Brooklyn.","id":"2587"}
{"text":"The grilled cheese at home afterwards was better.!!","id":"3282"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly greeted.","id":"1883"}
{"text":"The red sliding doors may be unique but they do not block off the cold air from the outside.","id":"2219"}
{"text":"Great service, great food.","id":"666"}
{"text":"The food is expensive, but worth every bite.","id":"1910"}
{"text":"sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.","id":"1018"}
{"text":"When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.","id":"39"}
{"text":"In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!","id":"2247"}
{"text":"It's the perfect restaurant for NY life style, it got cool design, awsome drinks and food and lot's of good looking people eating and hanging at the pink bar...","id":"2458"}
{"text":"Recommendations, of course, are required!","id":"2689"}
{"text":"We did have to wait at the bar for approx.","id":"1959"}
{"text":"You fellas above says its the best Taiwanese restaurant in town.","id":"2282"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's that good.","id":"2943"}
{"text":"If you love seafood, you would love this place!","id":"3228"}
{"text":"Good, fast service.","id":"1837"}
{"text":"Dakshin is one of the few affordable and tasty Indian restaurant in the upper east side.","id":"2333"}
{"text":"They charge different prices all the time.","id":"1296"}
{"text":"To dine at Thalia can be slightly deceiving because while its beautiful on the outside, its so bland on the inside.","id":"1842"}
{"text":"I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.","id":"2245"}
{"text":"My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious, new summer menu at Artisanal last night.","id":"2028"}
{"text":"I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.","id":"2810"}
{"text":"I have been going back again and again.","id":"3293"}
{"text":"It's charmingly small and that leads to an atmoshere that is extremely cozy and romantic, even.","id":"1916"}
{"text":"It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.","id":"343"}
{"text":"In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.","id":"165"}
{"text":"Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat.","id":"2508"}
{"text":"Overall, excellent restaurant!","id":"3659"}
{"text":"To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.","id":"3114"}
{"text":"The servers give you some sample slices of your order while you wait (shortly I might add).","id":"492"}
{"text":"The service was ok.","id":"1886"}
{"text":"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.","id":"3512"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it!","id":"538"}
{"text":"Don't expect to sit down inside though, there are only a few tables and they are always full.","id":"3156"}
{"text":"The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!","id":"1947"}
{"text":"The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.","id":"1929"}
{"text":"The manager claimed that he could not compensate us for anything on the bill which just shows the lack of sophistication from the entire group.","id":"740"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.","id":"2736"}
{"text":"But too far east!","id":"669"}
{"text":"Satisfying.","id":"677"}
{"text":"Highly Highly Highly recommended!","id":"2551"}
{"text":"it's the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food.","id":"2797"}
{"text":"We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.","id":"409"}
{"text":"we came here on a crowded saturday night and were seated right away despite being 15 minutes late for our reservation.","id":"3442"}
{"text":"This place is cool enough to be in the East Village, but French enough to make you feel like you could be in a bistro in a back alley in Paris.","id":"2878"}
{"text":"We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.","id":"158"}
{"text":"The staff are attentive, and have smiles on their faces.","id":"3186"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Shabu-Shabu Restaurant in the Try-State Area.","id":"654"}
{"text":"No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.","id":"52"}
{"text":"Largest and freshest pieces of sushi, and delicious!","id":"2125"}
{"text":"Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).","id":"3371"}
{"text":"but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.","id":"2115"}
{"text":"Maybe I say so because it looked promising for people who like artery-clogging jewish deli food, but turns out to be poorly run and awful.","id":"1546"}
{"text":"After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.","id":"753"}
{"text":"This place is greatly welcome in the desolate little strip between the Prospect Expressway and Greenwood Cemetery - a wasteland we like to call The Sliv.","id":"2560"}
{"text":"now if they could only get a toaster.","id":"3165"}
{"text":"You will find yourself returning quite often.","id":"2601"}
{"text":"When he's not making authentic Neapolitan pizza in the open brick oven or lightly frying zucchini blossoms, he's visiting the regulars (a growing legion) and checking on newcomers.","id":"3505"}
{"text":"Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!","id":"1747"}
{"text":"The ingredients taste fresher, the crust is thinner and crispier, the slice is less oily, and it's never burnt like it occasionally is at Joe's.","id":"1481"}
{"text":"Fish is so very fresh.","id":"1767"}
{"text":"The prices were CHEAP compared to the quality of service and food.","id":"634"}
{"text":"Go only if you are already in the neighborhood and don't want to bother going farther for a better place.","id":"3058"}
{"text":"Top spot in town for Vietnamese classics, better than places that cost a lot more.","id":"968"}
{"text":"less wait time for me!","id":"2300"}
{"text":"This was the perfect quiet, relaxing, and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater.","id":"2136"}
{"text":"The decor is really blah, and not at all hip or happening.","id":"1039"}
{"text":"Having discovered Ping's on the internet, we entered with qualms but were instantly put to ease by the fish tanks that greet you as u walk in.","id":"3138"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong at the Red Eye Grill.","id":"2722"}
{"text":"It appears to be the owner's first venture and it shows.","id":"1547"}
{"text":"I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.","id":"2597"}
{"text":"I go twice a month!","id":"1740"}
{"text":"We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.","id":"715"}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.","id":"2160"}
{"text":"The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.","id":"3437"}
{"text":"The food was authentic.","id":"939"}
{"text":"The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.","id":"3140"}
{"text":"I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.","id":"1714"}
{"text":"The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.","id":"337"}
{"text":"A million better places to go in the city.","id":"2027"}
{"text":"If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.","id":"595"}
{"text":"Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.","id":"256"}
{"text":"I ordered a Chicken Teriyaki dish and found that the chicken was extremely dry.","id":"764"}
{"text":"I love it.","id":"1375"}
{"text":"If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.","id":"613"}
{"text":"We had reservations at 9pm, but was not seated until 10:15pm.","id":"1329"}
{"text":"We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.","id":"3198"}
{"text":"Its located in greenewich village.","id":"623"}
{"text":"There is no excuse for such lousy service!","id":"3325"}
{"text":"Three strikes and this restaurant is out.","id":"294"}
{"text":"We bring in a party of ten or so every week.","id":"3375"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.","id":"3304"}
{"text":"So, a little inconsistency there but either way, both pizzas were really good.","id":"3608"}
{"text":"Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.","id":"3203"}
{"text":"We would return to this place again!","id":"3640"}
{"text":"Not enough wines by the glass either.","id":"3499"}
{"text":"I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.","id":"694"}
{"text":"I must say it's a little pricey for the food because it was not as spectacular as the view.","id":"831"}
{"text":"These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.","id":"271"}
{"text":"Just don't take the seat between the bar and the back half of the restaurant, i saw a woman get nudged 40times sitting there.","id":"2677"}
{"text":"No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.","id":"844"}
{"text":"We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.","id":"551"}
{"text":"My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.","id":"3709"}
{"text":"Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.","id":"386"}
{"text":"One should not go to Lucky Strike for the food.","id":"1704"}
{"text":"The service is awful--the last time I was there (and I do mean the last time) we were told that they needed our table so we would have to leave.","id":"1196"}
{"text":"We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue.","id":"3689"}
{"text":"To me it exemplifies Soho, cute, artsy, interesting.","id":"1379"}
{"text":"Try everything for that matter, it is all good.","id":"2142"}
{"text":"Both times we waited well over a half hour for a table (even though we had reservations).","id":"3472"}
{"text":"happy to be a regular at this place and would warmly recommend it to anyone.","id":"2372"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Taj Mahal for over twenty years and have found them to be the most excellent of the Indian eateries on this block of Indian restaurants.","id":"3561"}
{"text":"night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.","id":"16"}
{"text":"Try the green curry!!!","id":"2253"}
{"text":"We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.","id":"3425"}
{"text":"We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.","id":"2698"}
{"text":"You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.","id":"2496"}
{"text":"The food there are sastifying.","id":"124"}
{"text":"I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.","id":"2600"}
{"text":"I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!","id":"630"}
{"text":"The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.","id":"267"}
{"text":"I agree.","id":"1804"}
{"text":"Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).","id":"2657"}
{"text":"The food was good.","id":"920"}
{"text":"Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.","id":"2976"}
{"text":"at night, but it's hard to hear your own conversation with everyone else competing for that same luxury - the music playing in the background is also voluminous.","id":"2408"}
{"text":"It just wasn't Thai.","id":"2237"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed everything I have ever gotten and the fish is so fresh and always prepared in a great way.","id":"304"}
{"text":"I particularly love their yellowfun tuna and their mussel selection.","id":"3225"}
{"text":"I love to visit Murrays for my bagel fix.","id":"3154"}
{"text":"We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.","id":"2348"}
{"text":"Recommended.","id":"2971"}
{"text":"The place was nice and calm.","id":"921"}
{"text":"Cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $10.","id":"532"}
{"text":"I could have drank 4 glasses of water and still been parched - so watch out.","id":"1972"}
{"text":"When we sat, we got great and fast service.","id":"553"}
{"text":"Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.","id":"1681"}
{"text":"I think locals rate this place so high.","id":"2586"}
{"text":"Service is average.","id":"1734"}
{"text":"But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).","id":"2558"}
{"text":"Go girls!!!","id":"1522"}
{"text":"They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.","id":"3683"}
{"text":"The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.","id":"2715"}
{"text":"For asian fusion, there are many places further downtown.","id":"760"}
{"text":"Old school meets New world.","id":"120"}
{"text":"I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.","id":"2295"}
{"text":"The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.","id":"3513"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my new favorite places.","id":"2880"}
{"text":"For being number 1, this place has alot of work to do in order to truly earn its so called reputation.","id":"2034"}
{"text":"For myself and family we would only go here to celebrate an occassion, I do prefer smaller, quiter restaurants.","id":"3299"}
{"text":"The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.","id":"1208"}
{"text":"They all know you.","id":"2148"}
{"text":"My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.","id":"2192"}
{"text":"We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin.","id":"2020"}
{"text":"The buffet had a nice selection.","id":"915"}
{"text":"Waitstaff are very friendly.","id":"1768"}
{"text":"This restaurant is such a great place.","id":"302"}
{"text":"Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.","id":"3052"}
{"text":"I've been several times and am totally smitten.","id":"2956"}
{"text":"Terrible experience.","id":"569"}
{"text":"I love the place.","id":"658"}
{"text":"Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.","id":"1664"}

{"text":"There is a real gallery of stars that have visited.","id":"481"}
{"text":"The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.","id":"2827"}
{"text":"I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.","id":"1585"}
{"text":"Our first time in New York and we had to try a New York Bagel.","id":"2163"}

{"text":"this one is definintely my least favorite.","id":"2108"}
{"text":"I have been urged by friends for months to check out the mermaid inn.","id":"3452"}
{"text":"The miso soup lacked flavor and the fish was unfortunately not as well prepared as in the past.","id":"412"}
{"text":"Everytime my husband and I go there, we are never disappointed.","id":"3675"}
{"text":"They are the best bagels I've had.","id":"2154"}
{"text":"We were not disappointed.","id":"223"}
{"text":"I've read some of the previews reviews - people are either not New Yorkers or have more appreciation for ambience then food.","id":"1667"}
{"text":"Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.","id":"426"}
{"text":"$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.","id":"1964"}
{"text":"While the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge.","id":"3380"}
{"text":"Its a nice quiet location to go eat a good meal, relax, be able to talk and have a very good time.","id":"3185"}
{"text":"We arrived for dinner expecting to be impressed by a place that has an impressive past - but, that's just it -- the PAST!","id":"2651"}
{"text":"However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.","id":"718"}
{"text":"The menu is Prix Fixe, so be prepared to spend at least $60 per person, but it is Well worth itsuperb food.","id":"2848"}
{"text":"Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.","id":"596"}
{"text":"The wine list is extensive and impressive.","id":"523"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful waitress.","id":"1497"}
{"text":"While the staff at this little bistro is very friendly, I have never experienced more incompetency.","id":"2861"}
{"text":"The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.","id":"2697"}
{"text":"When we left at 8:00 PM, it was packed and noisy.","id":"876"}
{"text":"Okay, so I never write but there doesn't seem to fair balance of positive to negative reviews concerning Green Bo and it's time to speak up - I live in Chinatown.","id":"248"}
{"text":"The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.","id":"1116"}

{"text":"This big draw is the all you can sushi here for $19.95!","id":"1650"}

{"text":"The specials are usually quite good too.","id":"208"}
{"text":"They've the best desserts and mixed drinks as well as snack foods.","id":"1023"}
{"text":"Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.","id":"85"}
{"text":"That's good and bad.","id":"2388"}
{"text":"Really cool stauff inside.","id":"609"}
{"text":"While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.","id":"3417"}

{"text":"We visited Orsay during NY Restaurant Week and tried their $35 menu.","id":"909"}

{"text":"The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.","id":"3026"}
{"text":"There is usually a wait but it is well worth it.","id":"661"}
{"text":"Be careful, when they say spicy, they mean it!","id":"1437"}
{"text":"Your money could easily be better spent elsewhere (Anywhere).","id":"2532"}
{"text":"Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.","id":"1062"}
{"text":"As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.","id":"552"}
{"text":"Bring your appetites.","id":"1953"}
{"text":"The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).","id":"1722"}
{"text":"Of course this atmosphere is lacking, but what do you expect from a 24 hour bagel place anyways?","id":"1218"}
{"text":"Service was very good and warm.","id":"509"}
{"text":"For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.","id":"2318"}
{"text":"Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.","id":"2676"}
{"text":"Like others have said, don't expect the restaurant to make a nite out romantic for you and yes, a busy restaurant may require you to wait.","id":"1965"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place kicks ass.","id":"597"}
{"text":"Food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when I went.","id":"3317"}
{"text":"Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.","id":"1745"}
{"text":"The food is nothing like its menu description.","id":"3527"}
{"text":"Try the Pad Se-Ew or Chicken with Cashew Nuts for a memorable and repeatable experience.","id":"1387"}
{"text":"It's just O.K. pizza.","id":"3629"}
{"text":"I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.","id":"2168"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.","id":"3023"}
{"text":"The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.","id":"594"}
{"text":"THE BEST PLACE TO BRING KIDS OR ANY FRIENDS WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.","id":"1587"}
{"text":"The service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly.","id":"2620"}
{"text":"However, I do not understand the extraordinary hype about this restaurant.","id":"3106"}
{"text":"It's a small cute restaurant.","id":"262"}
{"text":"I will be returning.","id":"606"}
{"text":"Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.","id":"2871"}
{"text":"The food is above average for midtown and sligtly better than some of the other Heartland Breweries in the city.","id":"46"}
{"text":"Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.","id":"656"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible!","id":"1301"}
{"text":"Food doesn't appear to be cooked on premisis but there's a high turnover so its pretty fresh.","id":"1559"}
{"text":"Restaurant was dirty and unkempt.","id":"3648"}
{"text":"Nice place though.","id":"3705"}
{"text":"Warning: You may find it difficult to dine at other Japanese restaurants after a visit to Mizu!","id":"1051"}
{"text":"Similar to other Indian restaurants, they use the dinner special to attract customers at the door.","id":"3539"}
{"text":"It is a small restuarant so go early and it will be nice and quiet- go late and it will be packed!","id":"1648"}
{"text":"The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.","id":"3134"}
{"text":"The crackling calamari salad, which is usually a cheap disaster at many restaurants, is crispy and lightly dressed.","id":"2643"}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi place, but excellent for a $19.95 all you can eat.","id":"1655"}
{"text":"Shockingly easy to throw a group dinner here: simple contract, deposit only to hold the date the entire 2nd fl mezz for our grp of 20.","id":"1935"}
{"text":"The Thai ice tea was amazingly smooth and yummy!","id":"1254"}
{"text":"We've never had any problems with the staff but maybe we've been lucky?","id":"3021"}
{"text":"Drinks way over priced.","id":"1665"}
{"text":"The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.","id":"2432"}
{"text":"What I didn't like was how the food came right after it was ordered.","id":"2230"}
{"text":"But WARNING: to all those that use this site be weary, be very weary of recommendations.","id":"2381"}
{"text":"Moderate prices.","id":"574"}
{"text":"We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.","id":"625"}
{"text":"Try it side by side and there's no comparison.","id":"1484"}
{"text":"I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.","id":"3229"}
{"text":"My biggest complaint was the un-tasty food although presented well.","id":"1852"}
{"text":"This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.","id":"3053"}
{"text":"So sorry I can't rate this better.","id":"3630"}
{"text":"Most importantly, food is excellent.","id":"2070"}
{"text":"Buon appetito!","id":"2788"}
{"text":"Great roofdeck, nice group of 30 somethings, but no music, kind of quiet.","id":"2671"}
{"text":"If we were to move from the upper east side, we would genuinely miss this restaurant.","id":"3618"}
{"text":"The best part of the experience was knowing that the manager (a bubbly, friendly young woman with a great smile) truly cared about how we were doing.","id":"335"}
{"text":"Ok, for all of us growing up in the Village of NYC, we have spoiled by a plethora of restaurants, most of which stay open very late.","id":"2416"}
{"text":"However, service was as plain as sesame crusted Salmon I had.","id":"1845"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend it.","id":"3622"}
{"text":"It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.","id":"149"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.","id":"3571"}
{"text":"LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.","id":"1765"}
{"text":"So some of the reviews here are accurate about the crowd and noise.","id":"877"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and with that logic in mind, Spice is a great place to grab some cheap eats and drinks in a beautiful setting.","id":"2415"}
{"text":"Finally, after all the raving I went to check it out with one of my enthusiastic friends this last Saturday night and let me tell you its all its cracked up to be.","id":"3453"}
{"text":"Place should also have a 1,2,3 chili rating to be more authentic...","id":"1243"}
{"text":"The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.","id":"8"}
{"text":"Went last Thursday.","id":"2670"}
{"text":"I love this place more and more everytime i go.","id":"781"}
{"text":"I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.","id":"258"}
{"text":"Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!","id":"1713"}
{"text":"We only ordered desserts and drinks, but no refills were offered.","id":"946"}
{"text":"Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.","id":"697"}
{"text":"Waiters are slow but sweet.","id":"452"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch.","id":"303"}
{"text":"We went to Ino for Valentines.","id":"549"}
{"text":"the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.","id":"982"}
{"text":"It was good, but was not what I thought it would be.","id":"3354"}
{"text":"The music is the best among all the Indian restaurants I have visited.","id":"1323"}
{"text":"The bread and lamb chops I had before the meal were quite good, however.","id":"2899"}
{"text":"He always says, I don't have customers.","id":"1831"}
{"text":"Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.","id":"584"}
{"text":"instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.","id":"2906"}
{"text":"Good for dates or with friends.","id":"3645"}
{"text":"They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.","id":"3048"}
{"text":"one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.","id":"1322"}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.","id":"2089"}
{"text":"The kitchen however, is almost always slow.","id":"184"}
{"text":"The corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.","id":"3697"}
{"text":"Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.","id":"2364"}
{"text":"We had a good time.","id":"1573"}
{"text":"Also, the hostess called me today to thank us for coming and mentioned how she hoped that my girlfriend enjoyed her birthday - unexpected, but a truly above and beyond thing to do...","id":"1328"}
{"text":"people are rude bit again it's new york!","id":"3588"}
{"text":"We all felt it was worth it.","id":"2082"}
{"text":"The plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.","id":"1482"}
{"text":"Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.","id":"1372"}
{"text":"Service is great, takeout is good too.","id":"1602"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews on here, it appears that the restaurant is overwhelmed after the 7 PM.","id":"873"}
{"text":"The pizza is overpriced and soggy.","id":"1473"}
{"text":"Everything is excellent, the menu is quite extensive, and you eat with a view on both sides of the city.","id":"929"}
{"text":"You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.","id":"2738"}
{"text":"For the quality of food, a little too expensive.","id":"1675"}
{"text":"Came looking for this place because I heard good things.","id":"321"}
{"text":"I live on the street this place is on.","id":"249"}
{"text":"Horrible.","id":"3646"}
{"text":"Here's to the fake fish tanks too...","id":"3220"}
{"text":"Its worth the wait though.","id":"2395"}
{"text":"I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.","id":"2746"}
{"text":"The first time I went, and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere, I ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad.","id":"2718"}
{"text":"we decided to eat in tea room which was small and cute.","id":"2063"}
{"text":"What an amazing meal and experience!","id":"2691"}
{"text":"Unique apppetizers.","id":"350"}
{"text":"The staff has always been attentive and kind, and I've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in.","id":"2892"}
{"text":"IT is the best deal in town for a Monday night dinner at a fine restaurant.","id":"3227"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place.","id":"1692"}
{"text":"Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.","id":"3684"}
{"text":"and never strayed.","id":"3556"}
{"text":"The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.","id":"2104"}
{"text":"Leave the kids at home!","id":"3612"}
{"text":"This place has good potential, but needs a significant amount of work before we can justify spending that much money on indian food you can get everywhere else.","id":"2037"}
{"text":"Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.","id":"693"}
{"text":"And all of that won't break your bank!","id":"2634"}
{"text":"The Thai food is good.","id":"3184"}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.","id":"2752"}
{"text":"Great selection of wine, and seafood.","id":"519"}
{"text":"delicious.","id":"2369"}
{"text":"Acceptable prices.","id":"379"}
{"text":"Big thumbs up!","id":"726"}
{"text":"we were seated at the sushi bar in front of yasuda.","id":"3005"}
{"text":"We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.","id":"3490"}
{"text":"As I made the title, it's an affordable restaurant for great taste.","id":"3035"}
{"text":"They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.","id":"1068"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the price!","id":"2233"}
{"text":"Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French service as well.","id":"905"}
{"text":"It's easy to get a table for a large group and you don't get hustled out.","id":"2965"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices.","id":"2405"}
{"text":"Salads are a delicious way to begin the meal.","id":"1730"}
{"text":"I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways.","id":"1120"}
{"text":"That's why you have to pay more for that.","id":"1193"}
{"text":"If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.","id":"3314"}
{"text":"I loved it.","id":"1889"}
{"text":"They're are better Taiwanese restaurants and they are located in Flushing, Queens.","id":"2286"}
{"text":"The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.","id":"3516"}
{"text":"and you can't beat the prices.","id":"2799"}
{"text":"but I wouldn't wanna live there.","id":"1126"}
{"text":"Arigato Gozimas Yuka!","id":"1783"}
{"text":"Should you happen to be impressed by the cuisine definitely try it.","id":"1668"}
{"text":"I had the black cod with yuzu sauce, which was wonderful.","id":"3264"}
{"text":"Prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant.","id":"2922"}
{"text":"Tuk Tuk is one of the rare choices for me to go in Brooklyn.","id":"2506"}
{"text":"This quiet dark asian bistro is well worth the trip.","id":"2641"}
{"text":"I knew upon visiting NYC that I wanted to try an orginal deli.","id":"497"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place!","id":"422"}
{"text":"Total hipster-wannabe attitude in an otherwise sweet spot.","id":"1357"}
{"text":"Yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.","id":"1670"}
{"text":"Thank You Emilio.","id":"122"}
{"text":"First of all Dal Bukhara Rocks.","id":"2054"}
{"text":"Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.","id":"189"}
{"text":"- i asked for them spicy and they were delicious).","id":"1941"}
{"text":"It is terrific, as is the value.","id":"1410"}
{"text":"The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great!","id":"1488"}
{"text":"Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction","id":"2190"}
{"text":"The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.","id":"2653"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.","id":"2973"}
{"text":"(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.","id":"365"}
{"text":"The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.","id":"136"}
{"text":"The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.","id":"2236"}
{"text":"Off the beaten path, this jewel of a restaurant shines just one block away from the plethora of 6th street Indian restaurants.","id":"274"}
{"text":"Could be pricey without a prix fixe meal.","id":"2483"}
{"text":"This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.","id":"1096"}
{"text":"I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.","id":"261"}
{"text":"One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.","id":"2366"}
{"text":"Everyone was more then happy with his choices.","id":"2331"}
{"text":"Again, the waitress was awesome.","id":"3275"}
{"text":"Worth the trip from Manhattan.","id":"3232"}
{"text":"I loved everythig about it-especially the shows and actors.","id":"1591"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.","id":"2240"}
{"text":"The food was just OK, I would never go back.","id":"799"}
{"text":"Zero ambiance to boot.","id":"2923"}
{"text":"Got a little loud after 8pm when the joint got full.","id":"854"}
{"text":"Scalina Fedeli reminded me why service is so integral to fine dining.","id":"2854"}
{"text":"i recommend the thai popcorn :)","id":"3392"}
{"text":"I can't wait for the nex time.","id":"592"}
{"text":"Everything looks great, the drinks, the decor, the food, even the people.","id":"1844"}
{"text":"As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.","id":"2859"}
{"text":"The parathas and kebabs are made when ordered ensuring a level of freshness that is unsurpassed.","id":"2431"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood joint.","id":"2999"}
{"text":"The tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent.","id":"741"}
{"text":"The only disappointment was the coat check girls who didn't seem to know what a customer is on a realtively non-busy night (for the coat check girls).","id":"775"}
{"text":"My fiance took me to Scopa last week for my birthday and I couldn't believe the food.","id":"800"}
{"text":"Ummm...the beer was cold.","id":"896"}
{"text":"I take all my NYC guests to VT's.","id":"446"}
{"text":"It is sometimes a little cramped, and can get a little warm, but hello, it's NYC!","id":"2958"}
{"text":"We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.","id":"1618"}
{"text":"Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.","id":"2254"}
{"text":"Even with the prix fixe pricing, this restaurant is not worth it.","id":"894"}
{"text":"We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.","id":"1800"}
{"text":"Good to find a restaurant where the owners have some imagination and they have actually pulled it off, like in this case.","id":"3253"}
{"text":"However, their popularity has yet to slow down, and I still find myself drawn to their ambiance and delectable reputation.","id":"2411"}
{"text":"Where tanks in other Chinatown restaurants display a lurking myriad of sad-looking marine life in their murky waters, the tanks at Ping's are clear as glass with healthy-looking creatures who do not yet know that they will be part of some dim sum lover's brunch.","id":"3139"}
{"text":"The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.","id":"2667"}
{"text":"The view is spectacular, and the food is great.","id":"1002"}
{"text":"The place wasn't too hard to find, but it was kind of packed, as soon as my boyfriend and I got our food, the line reached the door.","id":"1181"}
{"text":"Good bagels and good cream cheese.","id":"1052"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.","id":"2832"}
{"text":"It is also extremely well priced.","id":"265"}
{"text":"Always great service!","id":"1739"}
{"text":"I am happy i did the food was awsome.","id":"2057"}
{"text":"I have been in many restaurants all over the city and Roth's Steakhouse has quickly become one of my favorites.","id":"1113"}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.","id":"883"}
{"text":"A bit breezy up there on the mezzanine from the wind coming from the tracks.","id":"834"}
{"text":"I went to DF for Valentines Day dinner.","id":"1968"}
{"text":"I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.","id":"237"}
{"text":"I LOVED THE SHOWS.","id":"1583"}
{"text":"and i have been around the block, to say the very least.","id":"2370"}
{"text":"We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.","id":"2638"}
{"text":"The aesthetics of this place are like an airport lounge.","id":"838"}
{"text":"Then, get ripped on free box wine.","id":"3377"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.","id":"2886"}
{"text":"If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.","id":"2753"}
{"text":"The food itself was just ok - nothing spectacular - but the service was awful.","id":"891"}
{"text":"The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.","id":"1469"}
{"text":"As there were so many to choose from we wandered up and down the street looking in the windows and such noticicing many empty seats ,except at Taj Mahal.","id":"3565"}
{"text":"Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.","id":"347"}
{"text":"Give it a try and enjoy.","id":"1841"}
{"text":"Good food.","id":"1691"}
{"text":"...and that's saying a lot.","id":"1545"}
{"text":"those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.","id":"2117"}
{"text":"The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.","id":"2593"}
{"text":"The only thing I could get attention from was one of at least two cats running around that kept batting at my table.","id":"3671"}
{"text":"if your into thai..you cannot miss this great restaurant.","id":"3384"}
{"text":"Going to Ballato's is like coming home and eating in my own kitchen, an absolute delight!","id":"103"}
{"text":"try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great.","id":"2076"}
{"text":"However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!","id":"3056"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the more underrated places in the city.","id":"2713"}
{"text":"for out-of-towners who will get a big thrill out of the location!","id":"824"}
{"text":"Everyone that has ever come here with me has become a convert and returned regularly with their own friends.","id":"962"}
{"text":"Food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit","id":"1666"}
{"text":"I go at least 3 times a month and have never been disappointed.","id":"561"}
{"text":"Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.","id":"138"}
{"text":"I think the restaurant was too loud (when full) to be romantic.","id":"1871"}
{"text":"I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.","id":"2631"}
{"text":"When you want a piece of beef, head on over.","id":"1979"}
{"text":"Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.","id":"2436"}
{"text":"Incredible food at a very agreable price brings me back just about every other day to this authentic Thai restaurant.","id":"1384"}
{"text":"I actually gave Patroon another chance before writing this, but the second visit was even worse.","id":"2669"}
{"text":"Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!","id":"3137"}
{"text":"Unbelievable.","id":"2662"}
{"text":"A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!","id":"1071"}
{"text":"I've been living in the Columbia University area for about 10 years with 3 kids - now in their teens.","id":"453"}
{"text":"The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.","id":"3698"}
{"text":"As soon as I wake up on a saturday or sunday it is the first thing on my mind is when and how I will be getting to fried dumpling.","id":"1167"}
{"text":"The staff isn't the friendliest or most competent, and I am stickler for service, but everything else about this place makes up for it.","id":"3"}
{"text":"My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.","id":"1457"}
{"text":"This restaurant was way overhyped.","id":"254"}
{"text":"I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.","id":"1530"}
{"text":"Delicious crab cakes too.","id":"2997"}
{"text":"Now at the top of our list, Del Frisco's Steakhouse.","id":"1958"}
{"text":"I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.","id":"3415"}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience I've ever had.","id":"36"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at La Lanterna.","id":"77"}
{"text":"Just bring someone who speaks Cantonese because waiter may not understand you.","id":"2087"}
{"text":"I thought I had died and gone to heaven.","id":"2617"}
{"text":"Not someplace I would seek to try out but if I am in the area again, I will certainly stop by.","id":"1501"}
{"text":"The bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!","id":"540"}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing great.","id":"3150"}
{"text":"Every waitress and customer who passed by me bumped into my chair.","id":"1799"}
{"text":"I have been going there since it opened and I can't get enough.","id":"2143"}
{"text":"Always popular, always full, always a wait.","id":"657"}
{"text":"In fact, you can't miss it.","id":"2711"}
{"text":"I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.","id":"2238"}
{"text":"A little noise but I think that was because of our party!","id":"575"}
{"text":"It is run by the same Sichuan chef who started the chain in Chinatown.","id":"1433"}
{"text":"Get the feeling they settled into a groove a while ago.","id":"2196"}
{"text":"If the omakase is to showcase technique and variety, serving almost 40% of items BBQ-ed and a spicy tuna roll wrapped with not-so-fresh nori seems to be a rather limp performance.","id":"1200"}
{"text":"I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.","id":"2833"}
{"text":"Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.","id":"3707"}

{"text":"I don't get it, what's so special about Prune ?","id":"2914"}
{"text":"I'd definitely recommend this little place.","id":"1552"}
{"text":"Again, if you are in this neighborhood - by all means, come here.","id":"3627"}
{"text":"The first 2 courses were very good, but the chocolate sampler was too rich for me and the dessert wine far too sweet.","id":"1867"}
{"text":"Butter was melted, white wine warm, cheese oozing everywhere.","id":"2026"}
{"text":"We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.","id":"273"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and walk the extra avenue from joe's to eat here.","id":"1489"}
{"text":"It cannot be the ambience, because the place is very cramped and some guests have to sit in an aisle.","id":"1318"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Shabu Tatsu at least 5 times and I always want to go back for more!","id":"660"}
{"text":"We were disappointed with the pre-fixe menu of only 2 choices per course (other restaurants offer 3 choices) and ended up ordering a la carte.","id":"2011"}
{"text":"Authentic Pakistani food.","id":"1563"}
{"text":"The staff has always been friendly without seeming grating, and the chef has greeted us on a couple of occasions.","id":"3235"}
{"text":"Get it together.","id":"3480"}
{"text":"The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.","id":"1459"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.","id":"1597"}
{"text":"Service was very good - prompt, attentive and non-intrusive.","id":"910"}
{"text":"My entree of hot pot with seafood was full of imitation crabmeat with a couple pieces of shrimp and squid, and was unnecessarily heated with a burner.","id":"1441"}
{"text":"We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.","id":"2016"}
{"text":"In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.","id":"733"}
{"text":"Its not curry in a slurry crap, and regular run of the mill food.","id":"3328"}
{"text":"In fact, while leaving the place we saw two people looking at the menu, and I couldn't help telling them that the food was horrible.","id":"1305"}
{"text":"Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.","id":"1951"}
{"text":"If you want Americanized Chinese food with your usual watery, generic white sauce, this is your place.","id":"1438"}
{"text":"The bread is the soft paratha bread (unlike the plain bread they use in Calcutta), and the stuffing is tandoori styled and very flavorful.","id":"2418"}
{"text":"Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.","id":"2555"}
{"text":"The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.","id":"2688"}
{"text":"The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.","id":"2737"}
{"text":"A word to the wise - the Hoboken health inspector clued me to his findings that this is THE cleanest restaurant in town.","id":"467"}
{"text":"An excellent service","id":"2440"}
{"text":"The food however, is what one might expect.","id":"1570"}
{"text":"I LOVE their Thai noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!","id":"2244"}
{"text":"I must give it Yon out of Yon stars!","id":"1781"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good.","id":"3606"}
{"text":"The only possible drawback to this last point is that as of the date of this posting, the additional menu items are only written in Chinese.","id":"1454"}
{"text":"Food is average, and I would say even the chain restaurant Baluchi's tastes better.","id":"3543"}
{"text":"The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.","id":"1206"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.","id":"2648"}

{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in NY for a few days and Pastis was a place that came recommended.","id":"1888"}
{"text":"The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.","id":"238"}
{"text":"The food there is so good that even to order out the wait is incredible.","id":"1164"}
{"text":"The bartender on my most recent visit was so incredibly rude that I will never go back.","id":"30"}
{"text":"Their sushi, Kamikaze and other Rolls are fresh and well presented.","id":"2273"}
{"text":"For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.","id":"429"}
{"text":"It's true, you feel like your in a scene from Goodfellas.","id":"589"}
{"text":"I read the other review and have to say I had the opposite experience here last Sunday.","id":"289"}
{"text":"The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.","id":"1846"}
{"text":"I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.","id":"958"}
{"text":"If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.","id":"110"}
{"text":"Never again!","id":"3514"}
{"text":"The only concern i have is with the slighly all-business waitstaff who order and throw the food down, rushing you out.","id":"2402"}
{"text":"Have the iced tea.","id":"1612"}
{"text":"For Park avenue I expected so much more.","id":"2826"}
{"text":"Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.","id":"3401"}
{"text":"So rude.","id":"35"}
{"text":"you can actually get 2 salads worth if u take it home and add it to some lettuce!","id":"1226"}
{"text":"The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.","id":"3544"}
{"text":"They are FAST.","id":"2304"}
{"text":"It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.","id":"3688"}
{"text":"The food is very good for it's price, better than most fried dumplings I've had.","id":"1182"}
{"text":"There are much better places in NY with better prices.","id":"1303"}
{"text":"Very neighborhoody, very quick and sufficient.","id":"1064"}
{"text":"Obv caviar is top of the line but the rest of the menu is so diverse it gives you a chance to taste so manydifferent varietys.","id":"212"}
{"text":"I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.","id":"1313"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious, though, my gf and I come here once a week sometimes- you will get addicted!","id":"1647"}
{"text":"And I could do without the cigar smoke.","id":"1982"}
{"text":"Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.","id":"2902"}
{"text":"I've waited over one hour for food.","id":"415"}
{"text":"Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.","id":"2822"}
{"text":"The ambience is very calm and quiet.","id":"3268"}
{"text":"Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.","id":"1100"}
{"text":"Great deal!","id":"1510"}
{"text":"Stay away from the latter since you won't go for seconds (hint hint).","id":"2338"}
{"text":"not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere.","id":"3345"}
{"text":"The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.","id":"1786"}
{"text":"Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.","id":"2754"}
{"text":"Our waiter and all of the people helping him were attentive and genuine.","id":"1942"}
{"text":"The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.","id":"1894"}
{"text":"This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.","id":"153"}
{"text":"Overall, the ingredients and technique are there and I am encouraged enough to return at lunch or dinner to see whether the boldness of the flavour palette improves.","id":"1346"}
{"text":"I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.","id":"3585"}
{"text":"Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.","id":"204"}
{"text":"The fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale.","id":"3216"}
{"text":"Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.","id":"1686"}
{"text":"This is the pinnacle of Indian Fast Food (all fast foods in my opinion).","id":"2419"}
{"text":"Besides, when you have bad service, that's less money you have to tip.","id":"713"}
{"text":"We do not need to go to a four-star restaurant anymore.","id":"2581"}
{"text":"The wine list is also really nice.","id":"97"}
{"text":"I thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others.","id":"161"}
{"text":"I plan on stopping by next week as well.","id":"1376"}
{"text":"Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!","id":"329"}
{"text":"Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!","id":"1067"}
{"text":"Ballato's is consistently delicious authentic italian food.","id":"98"}
{"text":"The service was attentive, yet discreet.","id":"2006"}
{"text":"As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.","id":"1721"}
{"text":"For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.","id":"690"}
{"text":"Then, IF they answer the phone, you're lucky if they don't hang up on you!","id":"3251"}
{"text":"They offer the same menu but have creative drinks that are loaded with alcohol and cheeky names -- but they do cost you.","id":"2272"}
{"text":"We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.","id":"601"}
{"text":"The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.","id":"615"}
{"text":"Highly recommended to all!","id":"2162"}
{"text":"highly recommended.","id":"2800"}
{"text":"Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.","id":"2525"}
{"text":"You have to increase the service a lot.","id":"1190"}
{"text":"Ambiance is barely romantic but management tries.","id":"2336"}
{"text":"I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.","id":"3265"}
{"text":"They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.","id":"416"}
{"text":"After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!","id":"3015"}
{"text":"After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!","id":"364"}
{"text":"It will be on my to do list the next visit to NYC.","id":"501"}
{"text":"Nothing better than buying a snapple for $3.25 too.","id":"1275"}
{"text":"When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.","id":"2330"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in Hoboken.","id":"460"}
{"text":"Service is extraordinary, yet not overbearing, and the decor brings a taste of trendy SoHo into Queens.","id":"1385"}
{"text":"The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.","id":"1088"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was delicious.","id":"3201"}
{"text":"If I wanted to deal with a crappy scene and annoying customers I'd go out in Manhattan.","id":"3481"}
{"text":"After a seafood craving, i checked citysearch and chose to go to Fish based on a previous review and the citysearch info.","id":"308"}
{"text":"Right off the major deegan you get ladies from all over the city.","id":"1157"}
{"text":"Until you realize that their five minutes is meaningless and your wait may be anywhere from two to twenty minutes it may be frustrating.","id":"2394"}
{"text":"always fresh and delicious.","id":"2176"}
{"text":"The food was very good, but not very thai.","id":"1129"}
{"text":"Thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you, but the food doesn't quite match up.","id":"1872"}
{"text":"The fillings may be unconventional but the dosa batter is definitely authentic and the combinations very tasty.","id":"1078"}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!","id":"61"}
{"text":"This is a fun restaurant to go to.","id":"1468"}
{"text":"The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.","id":"1268"}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.","id":"1900"}
{"text":"A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.","id":"843"}
{"text":"Their sake martini is wonderful.","id":"2184"}
{"text":"Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.","id":"1151"}
{"text":"Bravissimo !!","id":"115"}
{"text":"Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!","id":"2550"}
{"text":"We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!","id":"3635"}
{"text":"Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.","id":"2778"}
{"text":"When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.","id":"903"}
{"text":"Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!","id":"1227"}
{"text":"This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.","id":"2130"}
{"text":"It's to die for!","id":"1824"}
{"text":"Cute and decorative.","id":"3076"}
{"text":"I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.","id":"2269"}
{"text":"fine dining restaurant quality.","id":"2577"}
{"text":"Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.","id":"2666"}
{"text":"I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.","id":"1409"}
{"text":"The food was exceptional.","id":"956"}
{"text":"You will be satisfied.","id":"1912"}
{"text":"Another great place to take out-of-towners!","id":"5"}
{"text":"But, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria.","id":"1237"}
{"text":"We were less than impressed.","id":"881"}
{"text":"A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?","id":"417"}
{"text":"but still my date was bad","id":"1309"}
{"text":"Would definitely go back again.","id":"1598"}
{"text":"I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.","id":"582"}
{"text":"The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.","id":"864"}
{"text":"(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.","id":"711"}
{"text":"Sure, the setting is nice.","id":"2228"}
{"text":"Overall a worthwhile experience.","id":"2493"}
{"text":"The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.","id":"2879"}
{"text":"Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.","id":"3432"}
{"text":"It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.","id":"1212"}
{"text":"THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!","id":"1582"}
{"text":"Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!","id":"2287"}
{"text":"Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.","id":"1160"}
{"text":"Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.","id":"2773"}
{"text":"Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.","id":"2155"}
{"text":"And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).","id":"135"}
{"text":"Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.","id":"2839"}
{"text":"I had a great experience.","id":"3290"}
{"text":"The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.","id":"471"}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.","id":"2147"}
{"text":"The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.","id":"480"}
{"text":"The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.","id":"37"}
{"text":"Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan, I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray's.","id":"3160"}
{"text":"Go for it!","id":"3069"}
{"text":"Highly recommended.","id":"2072"}
{"text":"You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.","id":"1456"}
{"text":"Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.","id":"3174"}
{"text":"I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.","id":"3413"}
{"text":"I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.","id":"1954"}
{"text":"To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.","id":"643"}
{"text":"The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.","id":"1271"}
{"text":"The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.","id":"1631"}
{"text":"Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.","id":"689"}
{"text":"I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.","id":"3580"}
{"text":"We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.","id":"3524"}
{"text":"Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).","id":"510"}
{"text":"It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.","id":"600"}
{"text":"Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.","id":"424"}
{"text":"The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.","id":"3091"}
{"text":"The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.","id":"676"}
{"text":"I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!","id":"7"}
{"text":"The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.","id":"1371"}
{"text":"But $1 for each small piece???","id":"2091"}
{"text":"Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.","id":"1596"}
{"text":"big and soft as well as good lunch food.","id":"1232"}
{"text":"No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.","id":"967"}
{"text":"I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.","id":"1127"}
{"text":"By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.","id":"2576"}
{"text":"Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.","id":"2242"}
{"text":"Not a great place for family or general dining.","id":"2650"}
{"text":"As for the bar, this is another bad idea.","id":"2529"}
{"text":"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.","id":"3167"}
{"text":"Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.","id":"1217"}
{"text":"I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.","id":"1149"}
{"text":"The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.","id":"2644"}
{"text":"Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.","id":"2812"}
{"text":"What generous portions!","id":"1028"}
{"text":"The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).","id":"2167"}
{"text":"I was wrong.","id":"795"}
{"text":"The wine the service was very good too.","id":"573"}
{"text":"So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.","id":"1082"}
{"text":"The highly spiced chai tea was great too.","id":"1080"}
{"text":"No plans to return anytime soon.","id":"2929"}
{"text":"I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.","id":"752"}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.","id":"1641"}
{"text":"There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.","id":"3257"}
{"text":"While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.","id":"2897"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.","id":"872"}
{"text":"I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.","id":"2828"}
{"text":"The meat dishes were only so-so.","id":"2086"}
{"text":"His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious.","id":"3507"}
{"text":"We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.","id":"635"}
{"text":"The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.","id":"957"}
{"text":"I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.","id":"2249"}
{"text":"But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.","id":"1724"}
{"text":"For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.","id":"761"}
{"text":"And you're hungry a few hours later.","id":"1640"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back.","id":"2322"}
{"text":"I HATE HATE HATE this place.","id":"3476"}
{"text":"We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.","id":"2080"}
{"text":"The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.","id":"866"}
{"text":"You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.","id":"1031"}
{"text":"The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.","id":"712"}
{"text":"Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.","id":"3226"}
{"text":"Wonderful!","id":"3093"}
{"text":"It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.","id":"931"}
{"text":"The service is descent even when this small place is packed.","id":"979"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.","id":"1205"}
{"text":"Go hungry and enjoy.","id":"1414"}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of pizza here.","id":"3603"}
{"text":"This place is worth an one-hour drive.","id":"2809"}
{"text":"Great value for the quality ingredients.","id":"2567"}
{"text":"The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.","id":"1419"}
{"text":"The sushi is also great!","id":"305"}
{"text":"From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.","id":"2843"}
{"text":"Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.","id":"1931"}
{"text":"The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.","id":"181"}
{"text":"I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.","id":"3579"}
{"text":"The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.","id":"2455"}
{"text":"The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.","id":"2040"}
{"text":"The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.","id":"3080"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!","id":"2849"}
{"text":"though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.","id":"1465"}
{"text":"The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.","id":"2927"}
{"text":"This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.","id":"1544"}
{"text":"The lox is always fresh too.","id":"2161"}
{"text":"Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.","id":"3115"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly.","id":"1341"}
{"text":"So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to.","id":"3468"}
{"text":"Food was OK - fish was cooked well.","id":"840"}
{"text":"We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.","id":"1011"}
{"text":"The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.","id":"698"}
{"text":"The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.","id":"14"}
{"text":"The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.","id":"557"}
{"text":"I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.","id":"1788"}

{"text":"And the bill was outragous.","id":"1010"}

{"text":"We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.","id":"2642"}
{"text":"ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).","id":"43"}
{"text":"The decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining.","id":"1460"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.","id":"307"}

{"text":"Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.","id":"2594"}
{"text":"My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village.","id":"607"}
{"text":"Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service.","id":"1338"}
{"text":"The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.","id":"1625"}
{"text":"This place is to be avoided.","id":"2665"}
{"text":"Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles.","id":"2095"}
{"text":"The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.","id":"989"}
{"text":"My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.","id":"1803"}

{"text":"This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.","id":"3412"}
{"text":"Amma is nothing special.","id":"1311"}
{"text":"Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.","id":"246"}
{"text":"believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.","id":"1771"}
{"text":"Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!","id":"1913"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).","id":"1394"}
{"text":"I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.","id":"226"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.","id":"3642"}

{"text":"from an English speaking staff.","id":"3136"}

{"text":"great experience overall.","id":"2942"}
{"text":"PERFECT FOR DATES!","id":"2465"}
{"text":"The food was boring and expensive.","id":"2038"}

{"text":"The service is ok but could be better.","id":"130"}
{"text":"We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!","id":"702"}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.","id":"3510"}
{"text":"(I've ordered from the 2nd ave.","id":"3030"}

{"text":"The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!","id":"1683"}
{"text":"If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.","id":"195"}

{"text":"However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.","id":"1974"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.","id":"959"}
{"text":"A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30.","id":"419"}
{"text":"When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.","id":"2172"}
{"text":"I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.","id":"3518"}
{"text":"Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $3.00 in NYC.","id":"1171"}
{"text":"this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.","id":"1518"}
{"text":"The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.","id":"941"}
{"text":"The main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.","id":"2898"}

{"text":"I definitely will go back.","id":"2065"}
{"text":"I don't like Indian food too much and this was delicious, however you want to factor that into the equation.","id":"2468"}
{"text":"at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven.","id":"3558"}
{"text":"Finally!","id":"3063"}
{"text":"Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?","id":"1977"}
{"text":"Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.","id":"87"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed.","id":"2499"}
{"text":"I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.","id":"2093"}
{"text":"We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).","id":"2153"}
{"text":"From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.","id":"721"}
{"text":"Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx.","id":"1156"}
{"text":"And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.","id":"2409"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.","id":"3233"}
{"text":"The $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great.","id":"2359"}
{"text":"I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.","id":"3545"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.","id":"2968"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.","id":"210"}
{"text":"The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.","id":"382"}
{"text":"I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.","id":"1715"}
{"text":"For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.","id":"1517"}
{"text":"Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.","id":"611"}
{"text":"But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.","id":"2379"}
{"text":"Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.","id":"1643"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.","id":"2305"}
{"text":"We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.","id":"2989"}
{"text":"Beautiful experience.","id":"848"}
{"text":"The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC.","id":"2156"}
{"text":"If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.","id":"1966"}
{"text":"Decor leaves something to be desired.","id":"2088"}
{"text":"Jimmy is Dominican!","id":"1150"}
{"text":"Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.","id":"185"}
{"text":"Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.","id":"1710"}
{"text":"Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)","id":"2610"}
{"text":"When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time","id":"649"}
{"text":"in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.","id":"3450"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.","id":"974"}
{"text":"Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.","id":"3089"}
{"text":"The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.","id":"647"}
{"text":"The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.","id":"2954"}
{"text":"My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.","id":"378"}
{"text":"If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.","id":"490"}
{"text":"Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .","id":"3245"}
{"text":"This is also where I was from.","id":"1426"}
{"text":"Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.","id":"1992"}
{"text":"Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.","id":"414"}
{"text":"The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.","id":"1857"}
{"text":"The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.","id":"164"}
{"text":"Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.","id":"1480"}
{"text":"I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris.","id":"904"}
{"text":"I have never had anything like it!","id":"3094"}
{"text":"Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.","id":"1717"}
{"text":"And they provided a delicious dessert on the house!","id":"3663"}
{"text":"They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.","id":"3250"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.","id":"3366"}
{"text":"Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.","id":"3073"}
{"text":"I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.","id":"3303"}
{"text":"I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY.","id":"1299"}
{"text":"Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!","id":"704"}
{"text":"On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.","id":"2488"}
{"text":"Food is great and inexpensive.","id":"1839"}
{"text":"The price very reasonable.","id":"1756"}
{"text":"Dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!","id":"29"}
{"text":"It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat.","id":"484"}
{"text":"Take a good sense of humor,an American express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road","id":"1993"}
{"text":"Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.","id":"2574"}
{"text":"It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food.","id":"3595"}
{"text":"I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices.","id":"1097"}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!","id":"2844"}
{"text":"The staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb.","id":"2692"}
{"text":"I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them.","id":"2590"}
{"text":"THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.","id":"71"}
{"text":"THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.","id":"1584"}
{"text":"The waiters are sweet, the food is tasty and the bill is never too large.","id":"2957"}
{"text":"As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.","id":"2235"}
{"text":"The service was superb, they treat you like family.","id":"3633"}
{"text":"We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food.","id":"2696"}
{"text":"It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad.","id":"1186"}
{"text":"The menu may be small, but everything on it is delicious.","id":"3224"}
{"text":"Too bad Latin Quarters closed.","id":"1154"}
{"text":"They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL.","id":"935"}
{"text":"It was divine melts in your mouth.","id":"3306"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently.","id":"2312"}
{"text":"I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently.","id":"1742"}
{"text":"- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.","id":"3355"}
{"text":"When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.","id":"331"}
{"text":"Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms).","id":"637"}
{"text":"We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately.","id":"2029"}
{"text":"Kudos Haru","id":"2258"}
{"text":"We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The","id":"2341"}
{"text":"I plan on eating here more often.","id":"679"}
{"text":"I would definitely go back for a very special occasion, but not for regular fine dining.","id":"2004"}
{"text":"The well mannered, pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ.","id":"644"}
{"text":"The flavors robust and subtle.","id":"2007"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.","id":"723"}
{"text":"All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best.","id":"314"}
{"text":"I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great.","id":"3107"}
{"text":"We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.","id":"580"}
{"text":"The counter service is bad.","id":"1295"}
{"text":"I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!","id":"1590"}
{"text":"Service here was great, food was fantastic.","id":"2701"}
{"text":"its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.","id":"2514"}
{"text":"This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.","id":"997"}
{"text":"and we were thouroughly disapointed.","id":"470"}
{"text":"This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES.","id":"2730"}
{"text":"The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect.","id":"1491"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.","id":"1001"}
{"text":"Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x.","id":"906"}
{"text":"You will pay a lot for the decore, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.","id":"758"}
{"text":"They have some great entrees here as well.","id":"1601"}
{"text":"Our teenage kids love it, too.","id":"2877"}
{"text":"The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent.","id":"2195"}
{"text":"The food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.","id":"1917"}
{"text":"You guys are awesome!","id":"1796"}
{"text":"They do cater to American palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige!","id":"2252"}
{"text":"I loved this place!!","id":"3679"}
{"text":"I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful.","id":"3668"}
{"text":"I care more about the food and ambience.","id":"928"}
{"text":"Oh, but wait, we were out of drinks (which were also delightfully overpriced).","id":"1794"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs.","id":"3652"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!","id":"2853"}
{"text":"The service is fantastic.","id":"1163"}
{"text":"I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon","id":"216"}
{"text":"The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city!","id":"1109"}
{"text":"Food and service was okay.","id":"899"}
{"text":"great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...","id":"1349"}
{"text":"The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY.","id":"934"}
{"text":"The best pad thai i've ever had.","id":"2199"}
{"text":"Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.","id":"188"}
{"text":"Great pizza and fantastic service.","id":"1748"}
{"text":"We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.","id":"949"}
{"text":"i would just ask for no oil next time.","id":"390"}
{"text":"While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way, the food was insultingly horrible.","id":"885"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.","id":"1428"}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.","id":"826"}
{"text":"None of that yucky whipped stuff.","id":"1053"}
{"text":"The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.","id":"1639"}
{"text":"I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.","id":"1417"}
{"text":"Their coffee is quite good too!","id":"3159"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone.","id":"190"}
{"text":"great wine list (italian), good food, service was INITIALLY fine.","id":"363"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.","id":"2856"}
{"text":"i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.","id":"1811"}
{"text":"As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.","id":"1030"}
{"text":"They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!","id":"2838"}
{"text":"I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.","id":"3149"}
{"text":"Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain.","id":"2780"}
{"text":"Taxan delicious!","id":"1782"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.","id":"403"}
{"text":"Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price).","id":"3696"}
{"text":"Southern Indian cuisine is still there, too.","id":"3419"}
{"text":"Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.","id":"468"}
{"text":"Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.","id":"2876"}
{"text":"They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.","id":"2655"}
{"text":"For two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.","id":"3570"}
{"text":"Killer Sushi!","id":"2129"}
{"text":"Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!","id":"206"}
{"text":"Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.","id":"3038"}
{"text":"The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.","id":"3365"}
{"text":"And I've been to many NYC delis.","id":"3708"}
{"text":"This place is always packed.","id":"2068"}
{"text":"Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.","id":"1102"}

{"text":"My husband and I both ordered the Steak, medium.","id":"1902"}
{"text":"Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.","id":"341"}
{"text":"This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.","id":"1649"}

{"text":"The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.","id":"2539"}
{"text":"Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!","id":"180"}
{"text":"If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the service or the ambience.","id":"2580"}
{"text":"During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.","id":"3341"}
{"text":"I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.","id":"722"}
{"text":"Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.","id":"57"}
{"text":"We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.","id":"832"}
{"text":"Overall, not worth the money.","id":"3685"}
{"text":"This place is not worth the prices.","id":"346"}
{"text":"We left after one drink.","id":"2672"}
{"text":"Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.","id":"295"}

{"text":"Seating is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people.","id":"126"}
{"text":"This time, I prefer not to go into detail.","id":"1146"}
{"text":"Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare.","id":"1985"}
{"text":"Service was slow, but the people were friendly.","id":"2320"}
{"text":"Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.","id":"2103"}
{"text":"The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.","id":"2991"}
{"text":"My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!","id":"2268"}
{"text":"And affordable.","id":"3609"}
{"text":"The staff makes you feel at home, the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL!","id":"2146"}

{"text":"Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.","id":"3078"}
{"text":"Get the tuna of gari.","id":"1207"}
{"text":"I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.","id":"182"}
{"text":"It was a very nice surprise.","id":"827"}
{"text":"Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area.","id":"1416"}
{"text":"The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.","id":"196"}
{"text":"I am French and I really felt like home!!!","id":"1997"}
{"text":"I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.","id":"192"}

{"text":"I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience.","id":"2002"}
{"text":"Yeah, sometimes the service can be slow.","id":"441"}
{"text":"There was no ambiance.","id":"2948"}
{"text":"Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST service.","id":"474"}
{"text":"The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.","id":"3662"}
{"text":"But trust me it is so worth it.","id":"1165"}
{"text":"It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.","id":"1669"}
{"text":"THe perfect spot.","id":"1816"}
{"text":"The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.","id":"2471"}
{"text":"They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.","id":"1192"}
{"text":"DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.","id":"1373"}
{"text":"They never came back to refill our glasses again.","id":"936"}

{"text":"I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it, but they were not!","id":"3016"}
{"text":"They're rude at times, and not very friendly.","id":"1297"}
{"text":"I'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting.","id":"1528"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays.","id":"1162"}
{"text":"They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!","id":"411"}
{"text":"love the food.","id":"2796"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures.","id":"3634"}
{"text":"All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews.","id":"822"}
{"text":"There's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style.","id":"2256"}

{"text":"Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.","id":"1614"}
{"text":"The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).","id":"2109"}
{"text":"I loved it and would go again.","id":"867"}
{"text":"Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side.","id":"508"}
{"text":"SO SO SO SO SO good!","id":"1177"}
{"text":"Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.","id":"1187"}
{"text":"Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.","id":"650"}
{"text":"Very good value","id":"313"}
{"text":"Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid.","id":"785"}
{"text":"I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time.","id":"665"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.","id":"140"}
{"text":"I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people.","id":"1168"}
{"text":"Overall, the best bagel in town.","id":"3162"}
{"text":"Everything a NY pizza joint should be.","id":"1289"}
{"text":"It was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return.","id":"3242"}
{"text":"We go often.","id":"3526"}
{"text":"Light, refreshing summer rolls (not fried) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris.","id":"969"}
{"text":"The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.","id":"407"}
{"text":"moral stay away.","id":"1507"}
{"text":"but the service was a bit slow.","id":"922"}
{"text":"Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.","id":"1060"}
{"text":"When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli, I knew there was going to be good pizza!","id":"352"}
{"text":"No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.","id":"888"}
{"text":"Indoor was very cozy and cute.","id":"2121"}
{"text":"We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.","id":"559"}
{"text":"And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service!","id":"1302"}
{"text":"They're terrific!!","id":"3262"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.","id":"588"}
{"text":"The service is good and the resturant is clean.","id":"2289"}
{"text":"Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.","id":"527"}
{"text":"Just stick with the small dishes!","id":"2478"}
{"text":"The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.","id":"945"}
{"text":"I've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I've been going.","id":"1642"}
{"text":"Food is excellent.","id":"1766"}
{"text":"This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.","id":"2275"}
{"text":"They outshine HH.","id":"1233"}
{"text":"Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.","id":"2573"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch buffet for only $6.95.","id":"2323"}
{"text":"We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.","id":"413"}
{"text":"If you're not familiar with the cuisine, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards.","id":"2281"}
{"text":"both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.","id":"983"}
{"text":"Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.","id":"2928"}
{"text":"Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.","id":"2571"}
{"text":"The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.","id":"2122"}
{"text":"Just wish they'd expand.","id":"659"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly!","id":"2350"}
{"text":"This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.","id":"1119"}
{"text":"Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).","id":"1158"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.","id":"220"}
{"text":"You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.","id":"2285"}
{"text":"I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good.","id":"3254"}
{"text":"keep up the good work.","id":"1351"}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.","id":"2216"}
{"text":"great eats, good times.","id":"1467"}
{"text":"Make sure you try this place as often as you can.","id":"555"}
{"text":"Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.","id":"970"}
{"text":"For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit.","id":"3506"}
{"text":"Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!","id":"1123"}
{"text":"The service was great as well.","id":"2314"}
{"text":"Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.","id":"397"}
{"text":"Another plus is most of the entrees are approx.","id":"1395"}
{"text":"I will go back to Suan soon!","id":"2246"}
{"text":"Loved it!","id":"60"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!","id":"2987"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised.","id":"463"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.","id":"3457"}
{"text":"It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.","id":"3473"}
{"text":"I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.","id":"938"}
{"text":"We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.","id":"3177"}
{"text":"The food is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.","id":"2931"}
{"text":"I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!","id":"3017"}
{"text":"The drinks are a saving grace, but service staff, please, get over yourselves.","id":"1366"}
{"text":"It was wonderful.","id":"1613"}
{"text":"There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.","id":"2309"}
{"text":"Will give it another chance before I write it off.","id":"1905"}
{"text":"The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.","id":"2785"}
{"text":"Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.","id":"1946"}
{"text":"The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber.","id":"1638"}
{"text":"If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas.","id":"2472"}
{"text":"It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone.","id":"544"}
{"text":"The filet mignon dish was superb!","id":"260"}
{"text":"I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table.","id":"3482"}
{"text":"Can't wait wait for my next visit.","id":"695"}
{"text":"This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.","id":"2807"}
{"text":"The food is good, I can't lie.","id":"3120"}
{"text":"great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!","id":"3590"}
{"text":"I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.","id":"1534"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.","id":"1778"}
{"text":"Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.","id":"3071"}
{"text":"This place is worth going even if only for their beer.","id":"47"}
{"text":"I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).","id":"2995"}
{"text":"The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.","id":"2215"}
{"text":"Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.","id":"2100"}
{"text":"The sandwhiches are out-of-this world!","id":"479"}
{"text":"If you live in Upper Manhattan, Siam Square is THE place for Thia food.","id":"3379"}
{"text":"Decor is charming.","id":"1733"}
{"text":"The food was very well prepared.","id":"1885"}
{"text":"Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though.","id":"1358"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place.","id":"3533"}
{"text":"Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.","id":"2389"}
{"text":"While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.","id":"3087"}
{"text":"Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.","id":"2847"}
{"text":"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.","id":"418"}
{"text":"If you go for the pre-theatre menu, it's an even greater deal.","id":"871"}
{"text":"The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?","id":"1556"}
{"text":"Brava La Pizza Fresca!","id":"355"}
{"text":"If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, Kai is your place.","id":"3266"}
{"text":"The prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and taste.","id":"966"}
{"text":"Check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.","id":"980"}
{"text":"If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.","id":"167"}
{"text":"Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had!","id":"2546"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES.","id":"937"}
{"text":"I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal.","id":"2712"}
{"text":"I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.","id":"1170"}
{"text":"We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.","id":"3043"}
{"text":"Horrible food and Horrible service.","id":"41"}
{"text":"The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.","id":"3677"}
{"text":"Bleecker St Pizza is the best!","id":"1485"}
{"text":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY.","id":"42"}
{"text":"They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared.","id":"1326"}
{"text":"Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.","id":"2400"}
{"text":"THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.","id":"3171"}
{"text":"Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.","id":"2998"}
{"text":"Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.","id":"1627"}
{"text":"The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.","id":"739"}
{"text":"The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.","id":"2492"}
{"text":"Faan is sooo good.","id":"2198"}
{"text":"We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I'm not sure which dim sum dish it was.","id":"2390"}
{"text":"No you're going to go back because the food was good.","id":"3467"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better.","id":"334"}
{"text":"While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees.","id":"1558"}
{"text":"Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.","id":"913"}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).","id":"3003"}
{"text":"Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.","id":"3583"}
{"text":"My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!","id":"3581"}
{"text":"I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.","id":"2435"}

{"text":"My experience is only around the Parking forum, so my review is based on this specific experience. As someone who needed information on pursuing actions around an unfair parking fine it was pretty good to read, although there are plenty of other very good forums and sites out there too. It\u2019s free so that\u2019s another bonus. But as a normal person, just there looking for information, some discussion as needed and of course a little moral support, I was really shocked by the OTT attitudes and behaviour of some of the regular forum members. Snooty, supercilious, self serving and anti anyone new who\u2019s just finding their way with a specific issue - without the new people who seek info and advice from it, this forum wouldn\u2019t exist would it so why abuse us? I think the administrators need to \u2018police\u2019 it better. Just like any forum you come across, it has people there who for them being a regular on it is their life and it comes across that their egos are far more important than the purpose of the forum, which is supposed to be to provide altruistic help to members of the public. I\u2019m afraid I did experience bullying behaviour from \u2018regulars\u2019 with repeated attempts to belittle me. There were also some very good people and some good tips but as usual the bad are louder, distract from the reason you\u2019re there and tend to be what you remember.","id":"301972057"}

{"text":"I had ordered shoes from ORG616 with the size UK 8 but I received totally different size.  I have received different size of pairs one pair size is UK 6 and another pair size is UK 5 and both of the pairs are for the left leg.  I have contacted ORG616 customer support and asked them for the solution but they want me to return the item. My problem in returning the item is: 1. Covid 19 situation and going to the local post office. 2. Currently I am in country Georgia not in USA and returning the item from here to the ORG616 warehouse in USA is more costly then the item itself. 3. I have to pay the shipping cost which is another additional extra cost for me and wait when the ORG616 will refund the money for shipping (which is higher than the shoes price itself) 4. Wait when the item will be returned in their warehouse which is around a month or 21 working day + Covid 19 situation can make  the wait time longer and after I will receive my money back. 5. All the above mentioned is happening because ORG616 just put totally different size, both pair different sizes and both pair are for the left leg.  I have told all of the above mentioned to the customer support team but their answer is that they are sorry for the happened but they cannot do anything I have to refund the item.   I  will just through this item to the trash because refunding of this item is more complicated and costly than not returning it at all.","id":"301973598"}

For now I am still waiting for my money and if they do not resolve me I will resort to the corresponding instances, to that degree they have sent me. And right now they have me trapped in a cumbersome situation between the bank and them. Their customer service is terrible and they do not get carried away by the app that itself does not have many problems, it is quite well made and it seems quality, but boy is your system disgusting. In conclusion, DO NOT BUY HERE, and if you already bought you would surely have loved to read this before.","id":"301979029"}

It\u2019s much better than the poor interest rates on bank deposits.  It\u2019s a great way to get involved with the stock market with minimal costs compared to the major players.  A frustration is that not all stocks are available (easyJet and IAG) but there is a good selection of investment trusts.

The charts don\u2019t load properly and take a few minutes to fix themselves. Which has given me a heart attack more than once.   The ISA wrapper is a little pricy and if you do intend to hold on long term to the shares that is a excellent way to protect your profits. Here it costs \u00a336 a year.

The CSA I spoke to was exteemly helpful and told me she would deal with it and get back to me. I've just had notification from her that BT are honouring the offer.

This lot are supposed to be consumer champions but can't even resolve a simple complaint.  Martin Lewis must be laughing all the way to the bank with his commission from ripping us all off!  Signed up for an ORG600 blagged deal with Virgin promising \u00ac\u00a375 bill credit and no activation fee so expected my first bill to be \u00ac\u00a30. Received my first bill and no \u00ac\u00a375 bill credit and charged an activation fee of \u00ac\u00a335 so my first bill was \u00ac\u00a385!  Spoke with Virgin who took no responsibility and said ORG600 the only people who can sort it out.  Contacted ORG600 over a week explaining the urgency, received a response saying they would look into it and since then nothing!  No update, no support, doesn't seem they like care.  Have now had to raise a complaint to try and get this deal with.  Used to trust this website and their advice \/ deals and have used it for many things over the years but seems it's no longer what it once was now that Martin Lewis has made his fortune from the commission on all these deals he obviously couldn't care less.

{"text":"This is the canary in the coal mine phenomenon. If we can't trust ORG600 then what is there left to trust in corporate Britain.  I recently chose a broadband company based on their recommendation. The promised cashback never arrived. I have emailed ORG600 and have had no response. All I need is a copy of the recommendation article so I can prove that the cashback is due.   I don't trust them anymore. And since trust is what their business model is based on I can't see how this company can remain as lucrative a money earner in the long term.  A reputation takes years to build and a day to lose. They should be taking this seriously.  UPDATE: I SENT TWO EMAILS TO ORG600 6 AND 8 DAYS AGO RESPECTIVELY (INCLUDING TO THE EMAIL YOU PROVIDED IN YOUR RESPONSE) AND HAVE HAD NO MORE THAN AN AUTOMATED RESPONSE. DO YOU REALLY CONSIDER THIS GOOD ENOUGH?  DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA WITH REGARDS THE NUMBER OF EMAILS YOU RECEIVE MONTHLY FROM DISGRUNTLED CUSTOMERS ABOUT CASH BACKS AND VOUCHERS THAT NEVER MATERIALISE. AND TO THE PERCENTAGE OF COMPLAINT EMAILS YOU EVEN RESPOND TO. AND THE PERCENTAGE OF SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES TO CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING COMPLAINT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FULL TRANSPARENCY FROM YOU ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER. (ALTHOUGH I KNOW BETTER THAN TO EXPECT THAT YOU EVEN HAVE SUFFICIENT RECORDS TO ANSWER THE ABOVE, OR WOULD WISH TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION IF YOU DID HAVE THE RECORDS).  Edit on 20 March 2019  This exchange with ORG600 is ludicrous. I am apparently always just one step away from a response, just send your email to this email instead they say. Then when there is no response it's because some very particular wording was not stated in the subject line.  Let's be clear here about the issue. This company promotes other company's services and expects us to trust them enough to spend our hard-earned cash at their recommendation. Yet, when it is provided with information that clearly points to customers being scammed or misked it does not even care to respond. We are talking here about a company that has revenues in the hundreds of millions of pounds (which they have profited from our trust) and they apparently won't even pay someone to read the emails that concerned customers are sending them.   It would be interesting to know if the company is going to rot since Martin Lewis sold ORG600 to ORG102. I also think there should be an independent investigation into ORG600 relationships with the companies it promotes. (if it is too cozy then the public needs to be warned). I do hope that this final review does not get a response from ORG600 as I'm done with this and won't be checking back in to see what further false assurances they make with regards to a response. I know they received all three of my emails as they have sn auto-responder.","id":"301972055"}

{"text":"Completely sponsored by the ORG192 group so ORG192, ORG193 and other insurances of the family will come out first and cheapest with their quotes.  As a faithful existing customer, you will not get these nice prices though. We were a customer with ORG193. When we sold our car and bought a new one we asked ORG193 first for a quote. The quote we received stated that we would need to pay a supplement of \u00ac\u00a3534 on top of our existing insurance price for the car we just sold (we would end up paying over \u00ac\u00a31000).  When asking a quote through ORG600 for the new car, we received a quote that was \u00ac\u00a3505 with ORG192 and \u00ac\u00a3509 with ORG193 for the new car. Half of what we would need to pay as a faithful existing customer! So we asked to stop the contract with ORG193 and asked to get the new contract with ORG192. When giving the same details as for the Confused quote over the phone to ORG192 their quote suddenly became \u00ac\u00a3850! Wondering why, if it is because they know us as a customer I would expect our insurance quote to be lower as we have a 30 year no accident\/ no claim record.

{"text":"I recently contacted ORG600 regarding gas and electric options.  I was advised I could save \u00a3159 against my current spend which they stated was \u00a31399.56.  The reduced cost, with an alternative supplier, would therefore be \u00a31240.56.  Sounds good - not really as the annual cost has been grossly inflated.  My annual spend with my current supplier, after 11 months, is actually predicted to be \u00a31137.41 and not, as they say, \u00a31399.56, that is at the best very misleading and at the worst quite deceitful. \u00a31137.41 is considerably less (\u00a3262.15) than their figure of \u00a31399.56.  So their quoted savings of \u00a3159 is untrue and meaningless.  I have sent 2 e-mails to ORG600 asking for an explanation but have failed to receive any response.  Their so called predictions and savings are just pie in the ORG169.  As far as I am concerned there are only 2 factors that determine the best deal and they are, very simply, the cost per Kwh and the daily charge.  That is all that is required to make an accurate comparison,  Malcolm Cohen","id":"301973100"}

Sometimes my experience is perfect, and everything ive asked for is there. Other times, subs?!? The annoying thing about the subs is, they dont tell you they dont have your items till after 11.59?? By that time you cant do anything about it. Ocassionally they will tell you, your items, out of stock. But mostly they dont. Instead of getting a sub that they pick, id rather decide on the sub myself. But you cant do anything with the app after 12am. So you are either stuck with the sub, or just dont get your item, which is VERY annoying, as they more than likely have it in the next day in their deliveries. ORG411 do need a better system. Delivery drivers are always really nice, always a smile, so i appreciate that. Might give other supermarkets a try tho, just to see if they are any better.","id":"301977288"}

They are just too fragmented as a business and their software has become archaic compared to what is now available. I have only needed to call them once in the time I was with them. Somehow my tax I\u2019d got changed and I was sent a letter that they were going to withhold a major part of my account for the irs. I went to the link they provided in their letter and it was non existent. Long story my issue had to be bumped a few times to get to correct department that could fix the issue.   IB was great when it was pretty much the only game in town, but times have changed and IB hasn\u2019t. What I didn\u2019t like is that they started charging data fees  while other brokers included it. Their software is pieced together and there is much better available from other brokers and third party providers. Now that fees are becoming competitive I switched brokers.   I checked out their lite version with no fees. Apparently this does not include TWS. No thanks.","id":"301974208"}

I contacted ORG616 several times commenting on the problem that a shipment had been separated into two packages and that I was missing one, and they have not managed to manage it, more than 10 notices with their teleooeradoras and they opened an incident but they did not contact in this case with the transport company Mrw. I have also had another problem with Mrw with another company, but I called them and in less than a couple of hours they contacted Mrw and that carrier called me and brought me the order that was for food.

{"text":"ORG92 customer service has gotten worse. Their drivers have, on several occasions, indicated that a package was delivered, even going so far as to take a picture, only to discover they lied about having made the delivery. I have gone through the very painful process of contacting them, only to get no resolution.   The most recent incident began April 14, 2020. I ordered birthday gifts for my great grandson in Houston area, whose birthday was May 6, 2020. ORG92 indicated the package (with picture) was delivered on April 17, 2020. I ordered birthday gifts early because I was unsure how fast deliveries could be made during Covid-19. Some items were delivered on 4\/17\/20, but my granddaughter just told me today that one large package didn't arrive until YESTERDAY, May 6th, on his actual birthday. I discovered this today when I called my granddaughter to ask how Jasai's 2nd birthday went and if he liked his gifts. That's when I was told the driver knocked on her door to give her the package.  You might say, \"Well done! It arrived ON his birthday!\" However, as I have said to ORG92 customer service, when the drivers lie about when packages are delivered, it could create a problem if the item was NEVER delivered. It has happened to me recently, with the USPS. ORG92 indicated that the item was delivered and yet my friend in Chicago has yet to receive the item. Dealing with the postal service is just as infuriating as dealing with ORG92's customer service. Your package never arrives and your are out of the price of your purchases.   ORG92 seems to go out of their way to make it near impossible to get customer service. I'm writing here because when I attempted to chat with ORG92's customer service, I was switched to something called Just Answer. For the price of a dollar (which they claim is refunded) you then wait for the system to match you with a lawyer (yes, that's right, a lawyer!) who will then call you or email you the answer to your question.  Has anyone any advice on how I can do an end run around the ORG92 obstacle course. I've tried their chat, they no longer answer their phones, I'm at a loss.","id":"301973435"}

{"text":"This app is clearly polished, but it\u2019s evident that it is functionally deficient. Unlike other reward services, ORG20 wants you to use the app to scan your card, presumably so that it can first bombard you with all the other content in the app. When what most users want is just to store their card in Apple Wallet for easy reference when they need to scan it. Based on their Twitter feed responses it is very clear that ORG20 don\u2019t care what their customers want and they seem to be adamant in their policy of not supporting Apple Wallet. Even though the app description in the App Store claims support for Apple Wallet. My advice is to shop with stores and loyalty programmes that put the customer rather than their own business priorities first and centre.","id":"301977969"}

Good morning ,  I\u2019ve sent you the following email attached soon after I purchased the car insurance from you online on the 28th December  But clearly disappointed as I haven\u2019t heard back from you at all regarding the email below, the money has been taken from my account without you answering my questions below, I\u2019m not happy at all that you didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to respond back, I shouldn\u2019t be doing this during my holidays spoiling it if you answered back.   Also looking at the policy papers you sent me, it has a few mistakes  Firstly i bought the insurance since it was good price but also had \u00a3150 total excess ,however on your papers you sent me states compulsory excess \u00a3450 , please rectify that as it\u2019s not correct. Secondly, it states Driver as a smoker, not correct, where did that come from ? Find as circled as attached please.   Therefore, I need your urgent attention and kind rectification of the above mistakes and answer to my email below dated 28.12.18  Looking forward to your prompt reply as clearly disappointed so far ,thanks.

{"text":"I did the insurance Inside this website. I founded a good price but unfortunately the insurance companies reduced the price but grow up the fees if you leave them before the expire date. Brightside is one of this. If you used the monthly payments and you want leave them before the expire date (for example if you sold the car) they will be apply full amount of fees plus another \u00a360 and they deducted the last amount (\u00a360) from the full amount. In few words a FRAUD. That is a example that you found in the contract:  \u201cIf you decide to cancel your insurance policy outside of the cooling off period, the insurer will reclaim a proportion of commission back from us. We will apply a fee equivalent to that amount and deduct it from any returned premium from the insurer, or add it to any outstanding balance due on your premium finance.\u201d  This is what I signed and unfortunately I will be pay.

{"text":"Thank you to the customer service agent who, today, (sadly whose name I cannot recall) gave me some essential assistance and whose knowhow has helped me change my dual energy supplier.  I was most reluctant to change to DD, after years of making quarterly cash payments with ORG55 without incidence or any late payments. However, the only saving tariffs SP offers are to customers on DD. This means that SP is effectively excluding many people from accessing cheaper tariff rates. Amongst these are elderly, disabled, people as well as younger people or families on low incomes, or even those who simply do not wish to use this online service. Furthermore, within the documents explaining the new tariffs there is no mention of this DD exclusivity. Shame on them! They claim that this is not discrimination, but is very helpful to customers. Their reasoning does not make up for freedom of choice.  The ORG600 agent who helped me patiently explore the possibilities also emcouraged me to eventually consider trying DD, which I have done.  Thank you!","id":"301972140"}

{"text":"I highly recommend just using this app to strictly compare prices (ORG4 and ORG235 are also great apps for this and ORG235 has cheaper flights than any other place I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve found).  This is the second time booking my flight through ORG549. The first time was not that bad. This time though I had to do schedule changes for my flight. I called ORG549 twice. They explained to me that they had a fee of about $90 to change the date (no biggie I understand) and that I had to pay the difference in price (again understandable) my ticket originally cost $340 and I looked up online how much of a difference it would  be to estimate about how much I would be paying which was roughly $200 in total. I called the first time and I gave them specific flight numbers and time to make their job a bit easier, and the end result they were asking for was $800 which is a little over the top. I didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want to pay that much so I hung up and called again with in seconds to double check. And once I gave the exact information and everything the end amount was $1000 ???!! I understand that prices fluctuated but that was crazy. So I cut out the middle man (ORG549) and called the airline and ended up changing the dates for just $215.","id":"301978224"}

But I paid ORG549, not the hotel so...? I asked for ORG549 cust service supervisor & she said there wasn\u2019t one I could talk to. It\u2019s 245am, and I booked this hotel because I was needed to sleep before driving, but now I\u2019m not sleeping or driving. Also ORG549 directed me to another customer service line because they booked my reservation through another platform, booking.com instead of directly\/through theirs, so maybe this is part of the problem.

{"text":"Having contacted my current energy provider (Scottish Power) to look at cheaper tariffs as my monthly direct debit was likely to increase \u00ac\u00a3100 they could only suggest minimal saving. I had already looked on ORG600 and could see a ORG55 tariff reducing my bill back close to the original direct debit. I was told is is exclusive to ORG600 and to to use it I would have to use it from the ORG600 website. (crazy they can't offer existing customers the same deal on their manage account online) Anyway discovered this tariff required a smart meter and I have been advised before I can't have one ORG55 said after 3 months I would be reverted back to the standard tariff if I didn't have a smart meter installed.(This does not show on the ORG600 website) I decided to speak to an advisor and spoke to Alex he was friendly and knowledgeable and said if the smart meter is not refused but can't be fitted due to a technical reason (which is my problem) then you can stay on this tariff. Not wanting the hassle of this I decided to switch to ORG195 with a very similar cost to the ORG55 offer. Alex took me through all the information and confirmed I did not need a smart meter for this tariff.  So my first dealings with ORG600 have been very good I have while writing this got an email confirming all the details of my supplier switch. Thank you for saving me money Alex.","id":"301972139"}

{"text":"DO NOT USE THIS COMPARISON SITE! This site provides quote for companies that have no interest in their customers and people who offer low premiums but have no cover and every term and condition to help them get out of paying a claim. Do not trust the insurance companies they provide.   QA Choice Insurance\/ XS Direct: This company has caused me nothing but trouble and put me in the worst financial difficulty. I was a named driver on a car i got through my work for my mum. I had a seriously bad accident in the vehicle and it got written off. I made a claim and the company took 3 weeks to make a decision to void the insurance due to the V5 being in my name (the named driver) instead of my mums name (the main driver). This was an unintentional accident made when setting up the insurance and the company were not interest in the trouble this had caused us at all. Rude staff and no understanding for their customers. The company then changed us \u00a3300 to cancel the account as they voided the insurance, \u00a31500 for storage of the vehicle when they had taken 3 weeks to make the decision to void and \u00a31200 for the inspector who came to my house to interview myself and mum after the incident. The company refused to give us back our \u00a33800 premium and yet still charged us \u00a33000 charges. This has left us in \u00a324,000 debt and a void on our insurance policy. This company will do everything in its power to not support their customers and get out of paying any claim. AVOID AT ALL TIMES!","id":"301971581"}

As a gold member, I have a priority customer service phone number.  When I had a personal driver booked through ORG549 that never showed, ORG549 did nothing, and I had to call a taxi. Several days later, ORG549 said that they wouldn\u2019t credit me, because the service denied my claim, even though the service wouldn\u2019t answer either of our calls, the day I was waiting for a driver. Tonight I tried booking a hotel and flight to Philadelphia. ORG549 said my info was incorrect, so I reentered it. Declined, so I called my bank. ORG549 authorized the airline twice, but the hotel was declined, because it exceeded the daily limit. Called ORG549 Gold Customer Service, only to be told there was nothing they could do, except wait 3 days for the authorizations to fall off.

After over an hour on the phone with ORG69 where I spoke to several different people I was told I) hold on whilst I check and after 5 mins later  was put back on the loop waiting to speak to an adviser I) there is no such tariff and ORG600 advertises things that don\u2019t exist ( complete rubbish of course they don\u2019t) and ORG600 had made a mistake .... which it had not ! iii) yes we do have that tariff but it can not be changed over the phone   In exasperation I rang ORG600 and spoke to Carl James , at last someone who knew what he has talking about . He very quickly established what the problem was. He told me what he was going to do in order to resolve it and how long this was likely to take . He confirmed what we had discussed by email.  Another email followed where he said I should see the new tariff on my ORG69  account by the end of today and sure enough it is there.

{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. II has the most outdated process for any transfer that you want to do. My 5 year old can make an better app than theirs. You click on trade 10 times nothing happens then you need to go to  a laptop and it says, KIID document missing so this security is not tradable. No error on the app. Their call center said our app is limited we encourage our customers to use Desktop!! Seriously? In this century? All their transfer needs to print manual forms, sign, scan or send to them via post. Just to link accounts you can't do it once you have used your email address. The lady on the phone suggested to open a new email address just for this. LOL Ridiculuos !! Normal ISA can be moved electronically but JISA can't why? Unfortunately that's their process. The form asks for exactly same details. Also Transferring SIPP is a nightmare. ORG211 is expensive but for now I would stick with them, they never hassled me with all this ridiculous processes. All in one I wouldn't even give 1 star to them. Their call center takes a long time to get through and no one has any idea what's going on, the standard answer is unfortunately that's our process we cant do anything about it.  I wouldn't suggest anyone to go to II, unless you have a lot of free time in your hand.","id":"301974167"}
{"text":"This app should allow you to go cardless, either with a scannable we code or to add the card into apple wallet. Instead this app does neither. I appreciate that ORG20 are now stating they are working towards this goal, but this after years of people requesting it. Quite frankly there is no excuse at all for a large loyalty scheme like ORG20 to be so behind. As things stand you need a plastic card and paper vouchers to redeem offers. It\u2019s like being back in the 20th century. All this app does that is useful is give you your balance and last transactions. Really disappointing. I really think that the people who run ORG20 are completely disconnected from what people actually want from a loyalty card scheme.","id":"301977991"}

{"text":"I came on this site looking for prices on travel insurance. Within a couple of hours I was being harassed with emails. I was confused as I\u2019d specifically said I wanted no marketing emails when signing up. I tried to unsubscribe but was told it will take over 20 days before it would come into effect. I\u2019ve been speaking to the customer service and I was told I hadn\u2019t said I didn\u2019t want to get quote confirmation. I\u2019ve not even taken out any insurance from them. Speaking to my partner last night he said he\u2019d received a lot of emails after going on to look at car insurance once. Both of us said we didn\u2019t want any emails.","id":"301971527"}

I have been advised by Awin, (whom I was told to contact by a really unhelpful person at ORG600), that I am not eligible for the voucher, as I clicked a link for the same deal that I was sent on 9th July.    Awin advised me.....\"Thank you for providing us with the order number. We\u2019ve checked your order and unfortunately it is not tracked on our system, thus we won\u2019t be able to provide you with a voucher. The reason for this would be you didn\u2019t follow the links. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have better news.\"   Well here are the two links.  One from 9th July and one from 25th July.  Spot the difference.......  \"links not allowed by Trust pilot\"  I have also emailed your complaints department, because it is essentially false advertising if customers adhere to your terms and conditions of a deal, then they are advised that they are not eligible because you have no record of them clicking a link.  It's stupid.  You have outsourced your offers to affiliated companies, so it makes it easier for you to handball complaints to said affiliated company.

{"text":"Went to ORG600 to look for a new energy supplier, and it presents sensible questions on address, fuel and annual usage. From this, the theory is that all energy suppliers and tariffs are checked and presented to you. We were offered several deals, saving us up to \u00a3500 yearly. However, we almost failed to notice a little checkbox saying, \"Click here to show tariffs we cannot transfer you to\". Even when we noticed it, we guessed that it might be because we do not live in the right area. Being brave, we clicked it and revealed several suppliers that would save us up to \u00a3900, and signed up to one of them very easily. It appears that ORG600 will not recommend suppliers that do not give them a 'cut'. Not the independent or money-saving advice you might be hoping for...

People  please be very carful they doggy company platforn not working properly.

What a excuse.  Stock i traded had enough  volume it was  most active stock people buying and selling 20 k  to 30 k shares in one order i had just 700 shares They just telling excuses and not willing to compensate for their mistakes.

As ORG600 were so famous and what seemed successful I didn't hesitate in using them as a comparison site when seeking car insurance, however this was a big mistake.  They are allowing unethical con artists insurance company to control the market.  Unscrupulous insurance companies offer cheaper quote by a few pound then charge customers high charges to amend details such as address changes so customers end up paying much more than they would have if they had gone with reputable companies.  DO NOT TRUST ORG600.COM TO GET YOU A TRUSTWORTHY DEAL ON YOUR INSURANCE YOU WILL END UP PAYING MORE.

However, a few days later I was refunded for these two dresses and told me that reason was because they were both out of stock. I got into the site and found one of them which was ten times the price I bought it (from 15 sterling to 150). That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t send it as they made a huge mistake in pricing. Apart from being disappointed about all this, they didn\u2019t even apologize but lied about the issue. Very very let down.

I have paid all the money that has been asked of me for tax payment ($26,712) and yet the wallet has not been unfrozen. I have been asked for a further $6712 to unfreeze the cash. The man I have been dealing with is Peter  who is very convincing but at the end of the day he has ripped me off for over $70000.  I cannot get verification from blockchain if he is genuine or if I have been scammed out of my savings. I am a  old woman who has no chance of replenishing this money in what's left of my life. Whichever route, scam or not I am getting zero help from anyone at blockchain or ORG237. both these companies are welcome to take me to court if they feel I have maligned them as I would love to expose them for what they are. I have been left penniless after a lifetime of work so beware of these companies.

{"text":"Seriously watch out for the data ORG600 send to auto insurance companies to get you quotes. it just cost me \u00a349.99.   So ORG600 sent me a mail saying time to renew your Van insurance we have these quotes for you.... One of them was cracking so I went for it and ORG600 had told them I had 5 years NCB I did not pay much attention to this until I signed up then I suddenly thought hold on in 2016 I was involved in a shunt that's 3 years ago.   So called the insurance company to amend my data before the policy started and was given a new quote more than \u00a3150 more. so I cancelled and was slapped with a \u00a349.ORG176 administrative fee which according to the 14 day cooling off rules is permissible.  DON'T TRUST GO COMPARE TO FORWARD THE CORRECT DATA TO COMPANIES FOR YOU.  If I had not checked this my insurance would have been invalid and in an accident I could well have been charged with driving without insurance.  I will never trust ORG600 auto renewal emails again they are bad for my bank balance.  Looking at the feedback from GCP they serve no purpose if I need to constantly update them when I renew they are just a waste of space surely from a technical point of view the can do duplex communication and when an insurance company has a update it can update our records all we then need to do is confirm.

I called customer service and to see what is going on and he said he escalated the issue, next day the whipped out the rest and my account went back to zero, I guess that was their best solution to the problem, whipped out everything, then costumers should start from zero. after 15 years of building your reputation you don\u2019t matter to them. I used to think ORG92 is a great place to shop, secure, and save and, but now I am moving my business somewhere else, I am returning everything I bought during the lock down, because I was only shopping ORG92 during this time, assuming the are the best, but actually they are the worst.","id":"301973586"}

I was promised a \u00a3100 ORG92 gift voucher within 40 days of the 6th premium payment paid, which I was told after phoning them up on the 38th day. On the 42nd day I phoned ORG600 and was put through to the \u201ccompany\u201d that issues the gift cards. They told me that I had to submit my policy number which I did not have with me at hand. However, I rung them back within 10 mins and spoke to somebody at ORG600 and they told me that I need not speak to anybody else and that my voucher will be sent to me via email within 48 hours. 96 hours later I still have not received it. I phoned ORG600 back and they said I needed to speak to somebody at ORG92 who issued the vouchers. The person I spoke to said that they do not have my details on record or my email address and that vouchers are issued in the post and not via email. They told me to phone back ORG600,, which I did. agian, the lady at MSM said that they will issue my voucher within 48 hours!!!   Very disappointed with the customer service at ORG600.","id":"301972457"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is another one of those companies that are happy to take their cut of your money but offer no consumer protection if something goes wrong.  I recently booked car hire using their subsidiary website Travel Supermarket.  Unfortunately the agent at the end of the chain - ORG239 - failed to deliver the goods I had paid for - i.e. a hire car at Dublin airport.  This caused stress and upset for my family.    As the introducer I raised a complaint with ORG600 where they basically pass the buck along the chain, even including the consumer, as it was my informed choice to use the chosen broker.    Whilst I accept that ORG600 were not responsible for the issue they should be vetting the organisations they promote on their site to protect us as consumers.  Another disappointing company - great if everything goes right but offer no protection if things fail.","id":"301973152"}

{"text":"I WISH THE SYSTEM WOULD ALLOW ME TO GIVE THIS ORGANISATION MINUS POINTS  We have just started on our new contract with 247 home rescue for gas services and landlord certificates. This service is prominently publicised by ORG600 . The contract was very easy to set up. Then we were asked to do some (unnecessary) work at significant expense as part of the service, which we declined.  We were also asked to pay extra for bringing forward our services to fit in with our landlord certificate. it was very difficult to persuade them to have appointments within 12 months of the previous certificate. They finally found times, and duly charged us for bringing the dates forward.  The day of the services arrived. They cancelled on the day. They gave us new times on the following working day.  Then, a few hours later, the plumber arrived when the tenants had left!  Today, they phoned to say the services would take place in the morning. Then, at 11.30, they were cancelled again.  This is totally hopeless.  We would strongly urge anyone considering a landlord contract with 247 Home Service to look elsewhere. Even ORG197, with all its faults, is infinitely more reliable.   Why ORG600 is sponsoring this service is beyond our understanding. its reputation has suffered considerably by association in our eyes.","id":"301971744"}

My only issue is no quick link to the community which is a great source of information and a place to while away the time waiting for a result.

Returned an item from an order over 2 weeks ago, just receiving refund today, and after all that wait, theyve now refunded a fiver short.  Used my blue light 20% discount, and instead of refunding me the item amount with 20% less, which all companies do, theyve taken the full 20% from the entire order, off my refund! So I basically didn't get my blue light discount at all!  Yes, its only a fiver, but its my fiver, not theirs.  Beware of this people, if using a discount code.  I'll be complaining to their head office too.","id":"301973512"}

{"text":"ORG600 don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t check the quality of the insurance policies they recommend.  After an internet search in Aug 2019 on ORG45, we took out a single event travel insurance policy with ORG185.  A week later in September 2019, we travelled to the Airport and was in the departure lounge before hearing ORG106 had cancelled our flight. Thinking we\u201a\u00c4\u00f4d be covered by our insurance, we made alternate arrangements with the airline (alt airport, alt date), this arrangement did however occur some minor costs.  On our return we contacted ORG600 recommended ORG185 with a claim for our occurred costs i.e. extra taxi\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s, loss of transfers, purchase of new transfers and loss of night accommodation, total \u00ac\u00a3267. Only to get it bounced almost immediately via a email, after complaining they did but our claim up for processing via another company (travel insurance services).  After several unsuccessful attempts for updates from both companies, we got a call from a withheld number asking for confirmation of bank details. The caller refused to offer any other details other than she was from ORG185\/travelinsuranceservices (I forget which), I in-turn refused to share my bank details on the grounds we don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t share such things with unsolicited callers and that even if genuine I didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t want an unagreed amount of money dropping into my account and that being the close of the matter. I then got a series of emails asking for the same, which I again resisted for the latter reason. Then they assured me that no money would be paid without consultation, so I shared my details. For the next two weeks I got several requests for my bank details, despite them being previously shared and being part of the now very long email trail.  Two weeks later I again chased progress, only to be informed a Settlement agreement had been paid ten days previously. Exactly what I was worried about and was assured would happen. I then got a email confirming the settlement agreement and methods of appeal. Appeal I did and was rejected, stating the amount paid was correct, to their policy. Which I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve since read and found to be correct.   WHAT is the point of taking out UPGRADED travel insurance, if it doesn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t cover a mere \u00ac\u00a3267 of costs occurred when your flight is CANCELLED!!! They paid me 22% of this and made every step difficult, with their unprofessional and aloof behaviour. I hope nobody has a real holiday disaster, after taking a ORG600 recommendation and insuring themselves with ORG185!  BTW, ORG106 claimed the cancellation was due to circumstances out of their control and refused to consider compensation. So I lost a day of my holiday, lost my transfer, plus I was out of pocket and NOBODY put their hands up, said sorry or paid me what we lost!!!","id":"301972810"}

I acknowledge that I am partly responsible for the quality of the current service, PASSENGERS recommend that if they use are critical and demanding at the time of qualifying the conduit, DRIVERS improve their service and resume the good practices that drivers had when the service started, do not drive a taxi and ORG369 look for a way to improve service for passengers, recruiting better staff and if the rates charged to drivers prevent it from being profitable for them, adjust them.

I only have three comments-  on the app, the meal deals where you choose a combination of 2 or 3 things should have the items in groups as at present you have to scroll through everything to find all the different mains, sides, sweets, etc. When you buy unwrapped fruit such as mangoes, avocados, pineapples the best before dates have been removed. Lastly, if I choose a delivery between 8 and 9pm or onwards and have an item with a use by date of 2 days, surely that day should not be included as it\u2019s unlikely I am going to use that item on the first day as it arrives so late in the evening then the item has only one day before being past by its sell by date.

{"text":"Great UI, but essentially lipstick on a pig \uf8ff\u00fc\u00ea\u2211 unless you pile a butt load of cash into it. I do a ton of research before I invest, I use ORG212 to look at a stocks growth and performance ratios as well as all relevant financials. I can probably bet that ORG176.9% of dumb money investors using 212 don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know what a PEG ratio is or why they should be bothered. And that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s my point, why allow uneducated people to use CFDs and basic investment if you have no knowledge, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s basically gambling. Sure you might get lucky and if you have some decent cash you might make a return IF you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re doing cost pound  averaging.(if you don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t know what this is you SHOULDN\u201a\u00c4\u00f4T be investing by yourself.   You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re far better off investing in a stocks and shares ISA (which does exist in 212) leveraging tracked funds through an established broker or investing in a LISA. ORG685 and all the other platforms like this have created essentially a gambling app for the masses. If you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re stupid enough to invest your hard earned cash into stocks you have done no research on you deserve to lose your money. There\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a reason fund managers have advanced degrees and training in markets...you\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re probably not one of them.   To this end T212 and all the other pretty apps  like this need far more educational areas and regulating. You\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re in denial if you think you can rock up and make cash that easily without any blowback. Don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t risk your short term mental health and cash on a FinTech with little to no history or commitment to helping amateur investors truly understand what to do.","id":"301974364"}

{"text":"re: ORG17 home broadband offer through ORG137 expert.  The deal advertised is 21\/m and \u00ac\u00a375 cashback voucher. - Online only.

Apply by 28 Oct 2018  \u00ac\u00a375 ORG92.co.uk Gift Card when you purchase Fibre Home Broadband deals (not available for upgrading customers) - ORG17  ORG17; Superfast 1 18 month contract; Online Only ;  New customers only  '\u00ac\u00a316.84' Effective monthly cost  This effective monthly cost is made up of: Costs added up: \u00ac\u00a321.00\/mth ORG128 Broadband line rental & payment Rewards taken off: \u00ac\u00a375.00 one-off reward to claim from ORG128 Broadband   we have tried unsuccessfully for the last 2\/3 days made an order only for it to be stopped at last moment by ORG128. The order is not completely processed and one is asked to call ORG128.  We have today with our colleagues at work made online applications for the deal above through the ORG128 website. Unfortunately, on every occasion the order is not completely processed by ORG128 and instead they are sending a message asking the proposed NEW customer to call a number.  when the customer calls the number the agent informs the customer  that as you have not completed online the offer is not valid to you as you have called us and you will have to pay an extra amount plus you will not get the \u00ac\u00a375 cashback also.  This is quite outrageous as the ORG128 website is blocking customers from ordering the offer deal and the ORG128 is not processing the order through to completion.  This is very bad PR and mis-marketing to state the least. they will try and blame ORG137 expert and blame the website but ultimately they have marketed a product at a price and now it seems that ORG17 are not processing the orders from customers who order the deal.  have contacted ORG17 many times who state that its ORG600 that is offering the deal and they cant proceed...!  ORG17 have stated to contact ORG600 but to no avail. we have contacted  ORG600 but to no avail.  and ORG17 have stated via facebook that.... As this promotion is available through a third party Amir this isn't being ran through ourselves. The monthly cost of \u00ac\u00a321 is available for existing customers only, however, the promotion states new customers only. This may be the reason why the orders are unable to be processed by ourselves. We recommend speaking with the promoter to discuss this further.

They asked my proof of ID which i uploaded, got back a message the address was not readable, then provided the new document (yesterday i resent my bank statement and an electricity bill still no answer) however a lot of people never had this issue (nobody asked any personal ID verification from them). Now i waiting for 2 weeks now (the app says 2 MINUTES) cant contact with a real customer care advisor just getting back the same automatic message which is very frustrating. I dont know why the program picked me but i start to feel some people are threaten differently than other and this is discrimination! I really hope this comment will reach the right person and my situation will turn over to positive soon!  Edit: How the application decide who is need proof of ID even before i put relevant indormation? How come for some reason some people dont even heard of proof of ID validation through the registration but some people need it from the first second? My friend just registrated without the proof of ID. How can u describe that? I contacted with Trafing 212 several times even sent my documents but still waiting.

{"text":"Having recently switched to a new ORG197 tariff with ORG600, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4ve been well and truly stung. I switched to Energy Plus Protection Feb 2021v3 which included Home Care heating and boiler cover. I had  direct dealings with ORG197 regarding a complaint I raised. It came to light that our Smart Meter had stopped working several months ago, so our billing was wildly incorrect. Not U Switch\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s fault but the alleged new cost was therefore inaccurate as it was based on incorrect usage figures. Anyway ... I cancelled my existing Home Care Cover direct debit. At no time did anyone from ORG600 tell me that I was not eligible for the included Home Care Package.  I received conflicting letters from ORG197; one on 29th January advising that they have cancelled my allegedly inclusive cover and one on 4th February welcoming me to the included Home Care package. I phoned ORG600 to check  and it was confirmed that I am NOT eligible. The proposed saving of the cost of the Hone Care element was the greater incentive to switch, so all in all very disappointing. I will however say the the switching process was very easy and well documented.","id":"301972145"}

{"text":"I am currently looking to switch suppliers and found a company on ORG600, although they couldn't do the switch. This was on the 22nd August. Next day I changed my mind and cancelled. I contacted ORG600 who advised me that I could switch to ORG196 with  no problem as I had cancelled the other company. I did this and got an account and app from ORG196 (appalling company and I have written a separate review). On Friday 23rd ORG196 cancelled my switch because I had applied to another company and to reapply. I checked with the other company and they had cancelled me as requested. I asked ORG600 for help as they had advised me on the switch and they have been unable to do anything to help me when I have asked them. I see they are no longer offering to switch ORG196 so that tells me something. I went back on their website and now the deals are more expensive than a few days ago. None of this is my fault and I went on their advice. Perhaps they are only trying to get your business but they haven't taken any responsibility for what happened to me, hence this review.

I have made recommendations as regards service improvements in past (such as being able to sort by price & shipping combine to stop \u00a30.01 goods with \u00a32.50 shipping; put parcel in 'Special Place behind the rubbish bin') and then noticed them change policy; I'm sure others suggested the same. When things go wrong - and they do over that time period due to sheer volume - they have done what was needed as quick as I expected. A minor point, hence 4 \/ 5 stars, is that recently they have let some products with misleading descriptions be sold by the 3rd party sellers - and seem to be utterly incapable or unwilling to remove them and keep them removed despite multiple reports.  True, the external vendors are being deliberately misleading \/ deceitful....but ORG616 runs the site, they take the commission - so it is their responsibility to clean up their 'house'; the ASA agreed.","id":"301973840"}

I have another ISA with Share Centre (which they now own) and that has been fairly swift. I requested at the same time. Smacks of iii hanging on to the money deliberately. I have sent two emails now asking why this is taking so long but no replies from iii.   Also if I want to close my account I only get access to my online documents for 6 weeks. This is appalling.

We had been told by our current energy supplier that if we wanted a fixed price tariff we would have to agree to the installation of a smart meter by all suppliers.  Our main question to ORG600 was is the information re smart meter correct or do some suppliers offer fixed rate tariffs without agreement to fitting a smart meter.  The answer was fixed prices are available without smart meters and Wayne McCutcheon from ORG600 was very helpful in finding and completing a good deal for us to change supplier. A good service will certainly use ORG600 again.","id":"301972307"}

He dealt with the matter promptly and efficiently; did exactly what he said he was going to do, phoned me back at the times he said he would and resolved the matter really quickly. Extremely impressed with his level of customer service. Thanks.   Used ORG600 for energy comparisons. Clicked to switch to a ORG600 special ORG2 tariff (existing supplier). However, received absolutely no confirmation at all. Once I had filled in all my info I was advised that I would receive a confirmation email.  Waited and waited, checked junk mail \u2013 nothing. Could get no further details off of the ORG600 site. Tried an alternative comparison site and switched to a new supplier. 2 weeks later got an email from ORG2 confirming my new tariff!!!

{"text":"The app is good but could be improved in a few ways:  \u2022 The main way is to give an estimated time of delivery on the day of delivery like the one which comes up when you log in online. \u2022 Another way is to do what ORG49 does and warn you in advance if an item is off saled and not going to be in your shopping on the day it is picked. This would help to know in advance if a sub is acceptable or needs turning away.  \u2022 Also for people with dietary requirements or who have specified an allergy it would be good if we didn\u2019t get \u2018you could try this\u2019 style pop ups for items which are unsuitable.

You are only allowed to pay monthly now either by Direct Debit or if you still want to pay by monthly cash bill you are only allowed on their higher Standard Tariff and not allowed on other cheaper tariffs. ORG55 told me to contact ORG600 if I wanted a cheaper deal?? Sophia was a delight to speak to and offered me the best deals for me to choose.

It\u2019s absolutely infuriating when you spend time adding things to your basket and Broussard\u2019s g for it all to be emptied and you have to start all over again. For this reason, I only shop online with ORG411 if it\u2019s a must. With all other shopping apps, I add things to my basket as I remember about them then checkout when I\u2019ve got everything. With this app I have to jot things down and try and blast through and find everything within the allocated time, it\u2019s like a supermarket sweep. Also during checkout, on the upside I had some vouchers through my credit card, to apply and they went through no problem at all, but then it wouldn\u2019t let me checkout for free delivery despite spending about \u00a3500, it would only let me \u201cpay\u201d when I tapped on the \u00a33.ORG176 delivery option. It\u2019s little things like this that make this app so user unfriendly.  I shop online all the time, I don\u2019t go to shops, so as I go about my days, I like to drop things in my basket as I remember about them. I presume that the reason for the basket emptying is to make people checkout fast, but in my case anyway it totally backfired on ORG411 because,  for 1, it makes it a thought to use the app in the first place,  2, I have to paper and pencil a list and type and shop at a million miles an hour to get everything on one order unless I want to do lots of smaller orders and incur lots delivery charges.  I love ORG411 in the actual shops, very good customer service, but this app is just a headache for me. It\u2019s a real shame.   Everything ORG411 sells is of such high standard and along with the good customer service and very reasonable pricing, it\u2019s just a real, big shame this lets them down so badly.   Sort this ORG411!!","id":"301977632"}

{"text":"Watch out if you go to ORG600 for house insurance - CHECK THE COVER OFFERED BY THE COMPANIES THEY RECOMMEND BEFORE YOU BUY.  I clearly stated that my house had been flooded and as such wanted the insurance to cover this risk. ORG600 listed quotes from several companies and I chose the cheapest - but due to difficulties in connection contacted them by phone and gave the quote number. I have almost completed buying the insurance when the person I was speaking to casually mentioned that they didn't cover against flooding. When I pointed out that this was listed in the details I provided they simply stated that they couldn't provide the cover. When I went back to ORG600 to complain and get an explanation all I got was platitudes and the comment that it was entirely up to myself to check the scope of the cover - all they did was provide comparison and were not responsible for the level of cover. Funny though - when I went back a few days later to check if the same company was being recommended I found it was ...... but this time it carried a statement that it didn't cover for flooding EVEN IF YOU HAD ASKED FOR IT IN THE DETAILS PROVIDED","id":"301972040"}

{"text":"These guys misled me into funding my account. I received no less than three emails informing (and congratulating) me that my account application had been 'approved'. On that basis, I transferred a not insignificant sum. The problems started when I went to make my first trade, but received an error message saying that my residential address was still being verified. Surely, if my account was 'approved', that meant that all checks were complete and my account was ready to use? Apparently not with IB! I would not have funded the account had I not been led to think that everything was good to go.   So, on to the customer support, which is really, really, really, slow and unhelpful. After an hour-long live chat with excruciating waits in between responses, I was told that someone would be contacting me by email soon to help me get it resolved ASAP. I accepted that, but, still annoyed, filed my own complaint ticket as well. 24 hours later, I had received neither an email from an IB representative (aside from another generic one reminding me that my account was now 'approved' and funded!), nor a response to my complaint ticket.   Having lost faith in IB and wanting to take my business elsewhere, I tried to withdraw my funds and close my account, only to be told that I must wait three days before I can do so. Given that I was misled into sending the funds in the first place, I think this is absolutely shocking.   IB may be one of the cheaper brokers, but it is clearly a case of you get what you pay for. Avoid them at all costs.","id":"301974075"}

The customer service wasn\u2019t helpful at all and at the end after they wasting my time for 2 months and I had lost lot\u2019s of investing opportunity they said that they cant continue with my registration.  Small platform like this should be easy to use and register not this hard. Learn from Revolute (It\u2019s not a good compare bcs they are much bigger than you, still you can learn from the bests.)  I demand to delete my account because they wont give you this option on they platform and i had to send an email and God knows how long it take to delete my account.  ok lets get technical:   As a product manager and iOS engineer, I have seen lot\u2019s of technical downsides of this platform using theirs virtual money.   UX is not user friendly at all.  Portfolio is not easy to understand.   Verification is take too long.  Basic options are missing in this project, like user profile.

If you have things in your cart you can't add them to your order, you have to open the order and pick them all over over again. No shipping lists. If an order was canceled they delete it, so that's no way to know what was in there. And it goes on. :( It's really a shame.","id":"301977923"}

I generally prefer to shop in person so I can properly check the quality and fit. I returned the items via the ORG616 prepaid shipping method, hermes.  And its been 20 days and no refund.  DO NOT shop online, I am currently scrambling to get my refund.  There online customer service is lacking as no one reads my messages correctly and I get a generic response.   It was my first time purchasing something online from ORG616 and it will be the last.  Very bad customer service.  I will stop buying from them instore also.

It is always the driver delivering it to the wrong address or not following the delivery instructions I provide.  When it happens, customer service is usually good about it. Not this time.  I received notice that my item was next to be delivered. About 10 minutes later, I received notice that it was delivered. The picture showed a rug outside the door it was left by. I do not have a rig by my door.   I tried to call customer service and was told no one is answering due to the pandemic. I then got online and started chatting with a customer service rep. This was all within 5 minutes of the delivery notice. I asked them to have the driver come back, get the package and deliver it to the right address. The rep said it was scanned and marked as delivered by accident. I said, I suppose the app telling me I am the next stop, the package being placed in front of a door, the order marked as delivered and a picture being taken is all an accident as well? The rep said it was. Again, I asked for the driver to come back and deliver the package to me. The rep asked me to wait until tomorrow for delivery, despite me telling her several times it was already delivered.   She continued to argue until I finally asked for my money back. My chat was transferred 2 times to a different rep. The 3rd one finally said he issued a refund. We shall see.","id":"301973629"}
